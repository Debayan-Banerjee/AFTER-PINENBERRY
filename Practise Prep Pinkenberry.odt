Daisy(bit concerned) : "um..Mist,what is Trace doing there?"
Misty(bursts into laughter) : "Sweet Sweet DaisyDaisyl(bursts into laughter)..”
Daisy(laugh) : "what's he upto now?"
(Misty bursts into even more laughter,Lillie enters the room)
Lillie(bit flustered) : "um..Mist..what..what is it?"
Misty(showing everyone the ring,which she hid
before to give the surprize) : "first this"
Daisy&Lillie(wonder,smile,laugh,hugs Misty) : "my god!..within the night too desperately romantic!"(both smirks,Misty blushes)..
Misty(giggle) : "tell me about the time"
Daisy(thinking) : "um..(sigh)..i get it"
Lillie(flustered) : "um..yeah he wouldn't shopli..(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)(smile)
hey,what..(realizes and laughs)..i see that little brat had it with him all the time when he came in to do the swearing out at the middle of the night(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "and was mobbed while purchasing"
Daisy(flustered) : "um..no Mist keep an eye on him,in too much excitement he's being reckless"
Misty(smile,blush) : "um..as usual"
Daisy(smiles,Lillie smiles too) : "Mist,all these years..then last night... it's just.."
Misty(laugh) : "Pokemon Master"
(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smiling) : "i wish I was there,though Gary would've never kept patience at that time of
night,and i was so distraught..bit today as Dase told me..(smile)..he really has become a pest(all bursts into laughter).."
Daisy(smile) : "it was just insanely amusing..i can never forget this night"
Misty(laugh) : "and the time"
(both again bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smile,frown) : "hey,you must've woken me up..(laugh)"
Misty(a bit concerned) : "Lil i'm sorry,ok? but he was just..he was suffering as much as i was if not more."
Lillie(bit dissapointed) : "um, that's ok but.."
Daisy(patting Lillie,smile) : "Lil,all one needs to do is to understand the number and the contents of the hells that she must travel through/before she finally can get to her beau(Misty&Daisy bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(surprized) : "yeah,um..but what.."
Misty(smile): "Lil,all he was trying so hard to do was to desperately make himself believe that he has done enough to be kicked out once and for all from every relationship imaginable so that now he could just aimlessly roam around the world giving everyone a piece of his mind with his pokemons and fool around with his and all other pokemons all the rest of his life as if himself a pokemon,his image of being a Gengar was exactly true and what he wanted too desperatly came back had be be with me,that's all"
Lillie(flustered) : "yeah,um..strange"
Daisy(smile) : "Lil just let him come here today,i'll fix your meeting(Misty laughs), anyhow why did he turn on poor Trace again(Misty bursts into laughter)Mist,come on(laugh).."
Lillie(bit concerned) : "still Mist, isn't it just too strange..(Misty laughs and hugs Daisy,tears laughing).."
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,the hells he talked about to Brock and us Infront of his wife and then the last line,that even a recently turned public meance like him was stuttering about(laugh,hugs Misty,Misty laughs uncontrollably)"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,get a hold on youself sweetie"
Mist(laugh) : "it's...it's just..man..(laughes again) "
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,his last line was i don't choose anyone that's not exactly me"
Lillie(smile) : "Ah!that..um..i get it now.."
Misty(smile) : "Lil,all my tears of 5 years or so and all my strains ever all just got laughed away right now,and i've been hearing this since he finally confessed..this..this is..."
Daisy(smile,patting Misty) : "I guess sometimes things like that need to(Misty bursts into laughter again)(surprized,Lillie too) what(laughs)?"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,you needed this laugh exactly as your cure and even your first boyfriend Ketchum couldn't give it(laugh)"
Misty(smile,Daisy Laughs) : "well he will argue on this,but Dase(laugh)..um..sorry..it's just that almost any words is reminding me of his antics since we patched up again.. blush,Daisy&Lillie smirks)..um..anyway,he told me some novels yesterday and the same which Trace is being minutely and intricately introduced to now(laugh,Daisy laughs)..out of which one was on the fact that you and your beau are always ever a couple like as if this life itself a play but you two have always stayed as a couple like forever..as if a destiny..(laugh)but if one said destiny,he'd mouth them off to hell(laugh)..um,sorry..then from there came his ultimate point"
Daisy&Lillie(unison,smile) : "go on pretty interesting"
Misty(smile) : "see and its about the very personal life of a couple and he has even laughed that barrier off amongst all of us in a way that's just unbelievable (laugh)..um..please bear with me..(again laugh)..um..sorry, it's just impossible to forget the antics..and it was only yesterday afternoon when he was absolutely hellbent and on creating every unimaginably cruel and unsurmountable barrier possible between
anything and himself..(smile) Dase,Lil,we're sisters,and your husbands all of us..we've just been so intricately bound for so so many years,as one unit,then Ash breaks away and we go through all this and then no matter what,we always had some distance regarding personal life an then suddenly..(laughs again)..um..please stay with me..his words are still buzzing in my ears..suddenly he app...(laughs uncontrollably)..i just can't take..(more laugh).."
Daisy(smile) : "you know Mist,that day with Mrs. Ketchum,we kinda always felt a distance since but she also was so cheerful today,we ourselves just laughed it off"(then Daisy leaves the room for some work)
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,um..i feel happy too but i wish icould hear it LIVE"
Misty(laugh) : "all you need to do is to tell him we were destined to each other in a way so that he feels as though your not saying it directly but insinuating..(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(bit flustered) : "um..i see but..(Misty laughs uncontrollably)(frown) Mist,cut it(smile)"
Misty(laugh) : "Lil,really i need help(hugging Lillie)...the way you are speaking is exactly the right one to insinuate something to him(laugh)"
Lillie(smile,hugging Misty) : "i see.."
Misty(smile) : "seriously Lil,i've been living a dream since we patched up,and you know it doesn't even feel a bit strange to suddenly call him my husband at all,as if the fact i was ever anything but his wife is very strange it feels"
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,we were taken aback when he suddenly talked about marriage yesterday but i thought he was just stressing upon the word but now i see the little prick really meant it(Misty laughs)"
Misty(smile) : "absolutely,and all this words started to flow as soon as he confessed and hasn't stopped since then..he just goes from extremely serious mood to absolutely 5 year chil mood jusy one moment apart..but you know his words are as honest as you can believe no matter what the mood is..and as i was saying you can't say it was our destiny or we were right or best or perfect at all,which possibly is what he is
rigourusly teaching Trace now(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(bit confused): "um..(smile) i see soulmate..always together no matter what..and then he probably extended it to saying all else was like a bad dream not really existent"
Misty(smiles,hugs Lillie) : "exactly"
Lillie(smile,hugs Misty) : "and thats seeing yourself in your spouse and the hellfire(smile,Misty giggles)..and that's exactly about yesterday-Laugh it out(both Giggle)Mist,your beau has turned himself into the Greatest Romance Master as well...(both laugh)Viol would've ate him up in joy had she been present physically here(both laugh)"
Misty(laughing) : "she almost did today itself.."
Lillie(smile) : "Viol too?"
Misty(smiles) : "oh yes!but she can't come before a day after tomorrow but then(laugh)..he's hellbent to runaway with me to unknown islands any moment(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laughs) : "hmm..that dense little pest has now got real dense.."(both laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "mom said,too much imagination"(again both bursts into laughter)
(Daisy enters,laughing)
Misty(laugh) : "what?Trace was scared to death?(laughes,Lillie smiles)"
Daisy(laugh) : "no not Trace,the brat himself(all laugh),said Trace is a bit busy today will be late retunring at 16:30(all laugh)..said(laugh),sorry Daisy but that sketch was so nice i’ve compelled him today that sketching for 39 years today you write stories while i review(all laugh) i realized that poor Trace is a hostage today(all laugh,Lillie
and Misty giggles and hi-fives)and yeah pretty much is being killed off now,(all laugh)it’s just that i guess that none can ever insinuate that(Misty laughes aloud) that his flower was never ever not his no matter what(laughs)"
Lillie&Misty(giggling,Unison,high-five) : "SOULMATE!"(all three bursts into laughter in a group hug)
Lillie(laugh) : "i just can't believe how can one have such belief on himself to be right that he just nonchalantly came to patch up as if nothing ever happened and all was a play and that very thing turns out to be true the very next morning..the very next day all the difficulties that may be we ever had of any kind among ourselves has been just laughed away with no effort..Mist,this guy's real dense keep an eye always(all laugh).."
Daisy(laughes) : "and sorry Mist,but even yesterday all we thought was that he was indeed a cheat,and then the next day we ourselves just can't help but to laugh any resentment off..(all laugh)..this is Patch-Up Master"(all laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "and yet you don't know what he did at Cerulian..(laugh)..oh god!..(all laughs)..after he gave me the ring i came to know that he had first travelled to Cerulian,a city which is his enemy no 1 and you know the viseversa (laughs again).."
Daisy&Lillie(smile) : "um..yeah but why would he turn on Cerulian,Mist?"
Misty(laugh) : "because his flower had to appease random guys coming around for gym badges at any time of the day...(all laugh)..(smile)..no you know what i just feel bad,he's trying so hard to make up for the years that he wasn't with me and his method is to either torture himself enough to see how i was actually feeling,but his playfullness won't allow that so he has turned his attention on in-his-words Cerulian Brats(laughs) roaming around the streets to insinuate(bursts into laughter)
Daisy(laugh) : "with that language and antics and his pests to add to,he'll restart the Sensational Sinisters there(all burst into laughter).."
Misty(laughing) : "and if i ever go back to perform again he must be managing and won't allow anyone except married woman with girl childs aged below 8"(all bursts into further laughter)
Lillie(laughing) : "yeah Mist,he's just too desparate to make the amends and already doing so with his antics"(all laugh)
Misty(laughing) : "and i've been going through for so many hours haven't slept a bit and look how fresh i'm...it's just.."
Daisy&Lillie(Unison) : "Pokemon Master"(all burst into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "apart from the godforsaken Cerulian brats(all laughs)..he's even more incensed with Vultures..(bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "that's the reporters and pests"(all laugh)
Lillie(laugh) : "and they'll insinuate(Misty bursts into laughter again) always that whatever he may do,he's just trying to trick people and that he's a Playboy"
Misty(laugh) : "exactly,i see the pain that he had been feeling since our separation inside and just had turned on anything that had a hint of reminder to him about queries on his own personal life and anything related to me,same as me just wanted to forget me couldn’t finally realized and so back here but(laugh) you saw his methods(all laugh)"
Daisy(smile,bit concerned) : "no Mist,as stubborn as you if not more,would never still come back normally that is(all laugh) and say he was sorry if he doesn't believe he's done any mistake and would torture himself to death trying to prove to himself that he was morally right as Guzzlord dictates(all laugh) and that is all to him let the relationship go if they don't understand me"
Lillie(smile) : "exactly like you Mist,and as you said and even now so desperate to heal any kind of pain that he only now glaringly feels he's put you through unknowingly,now desperately wants to go through you pains again and again to justify himself,really i mean you two truely as he said.."
Misty(laugh) : "along with Chu this morning,master brat and 2nd not not male brat,wasn’t seeing each other for ages only to get this moment most ENGAGING(all burst into laughter),i see too much bonhomie"(all burst into laughter)
Daisy(laugh) : “so already the introductions have been done(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “where(all burst into laughter)..and the introduction was Gengleye(all laugh),i get in Chu knew me and Sableye too not Gengar and actually well you know yesterday he had 9 ghosts and Greninja looking after me when i was too emotional(all smile) and there Sableye,Gengar,Hoopa,Dusknoir,Confragigus,Malamar,Spiritomb,Darkrai and Marshadow was there...and also during break-in Sableye was on me and you know he taught all to differentiate not males(all laugh) i’ve been excluded no matter what cause as you know Misty-psychophysicality=Mist(all laugh)..that never changed(smile looking at her ring,all others smile) anyway,so Chu first says,Mr Misty(laugh,all laugh and shake their heads) i see the name is known as well as you when you were rather mentally greener(all burst into laughter) now i see rather happy wrongly cause this idea of master brat as it appears to you is only yours ain’t it(all burst into laughter) anyway, but what’s thy condition cause the report says you were lost in the mist of self and it’s cognition(all burst into laughter),you see Mr Misty(all laugh),this idea that you have about the cognitive process is only an hindrence upon you cause you cling onto things that aren’t you to know you cause your basic premise that you’re you is your trouble to being with ain’t it(all burst into laughter),exactly why you must be tickled after each meal(all burst into laughter),the different foods you have experiential of cognitive that derives an idea of you being confined and those foods contaminate your self hence your current state of seriousness about the varieties of tickling(all unontrollably laugh) thus tickling itself is the right food isn’t it if you can tickle yourself why this urge to know what’s tickling(all brust into laughter) the mental sensation that is(all brust into laughter),see Mr Misty(all laugh) this Gengarian view of life is rather smooth(all uncontrollbaly laugh,tears),this stupendus urge you have to be sane why(all uncontrollably laugh,tears,fits of laughter) cause you want to be tickled(all burst into laughter) but if you’re sane one tickling becomes an idea to you hence you don’t get the gist of it that is tickling yourself each moment to become tickling self rather than that which is being tickled(all burst into laughter) do you know when you feel i should’ve done this,this and that then the different emotions come up and they tickle you(all brust into laughter) but Mr Misty have you ever given a thought who is actually tickled to produced the feeling of idea of being tickled(all burst into laughter) cause if you’re truely tickled then you will become that hence why would you try to cogitate anything that’s not you like your own being cause had that tickled you,you would’ve tickled that too making both unified hence what remains is pure tickling ain’t it(all burst into laughter),thus Mr Misty,a Sableye is tested when he is born whether he has any materials of insanity or not by means of reciprocration tickling(all burst into laughter)..then that brat Gengar tickled me and Sableye compelled me to tickle them both and Chu to see if i have any material to become mad(all burst into laughter)..then,my Ash came back after encircling everywhere(all laugh) and said all cause of the fact that they were bored to death cause they had to look after me(all laugh)..”
Lillie(laugh) : “man,some pests these are(all laugh) master brat(all laugh)..you know Mist i used to tell you these are utter brats(all laugh)..”
Misty(laugh) : “had i given Glalie a few choised company(all laugh) i would’ve been at Unova too still(all laugh)..and my Ash too is at that level you know Drew and May the mad vomit spew(all laugh) and he will go further now that he couldn’t yet only cause i was missing(all laugh)..”
Daisy(laugh) : “man Trace says this is living hell of joviality(all laugh)..but was he demostratig tickling yesterday for 6 hours(all burst into laughter)..”
Misty(laugh) : "via insinuations(all laugh)..(smile)..um,no you know when he met me yesterday and himself was describing what he did to you and all else i could just see how much pain he's constantly self inflicting,he real nature is ever the sweetly abstract Ash,but as we broke up and he felt that that nature is exactly what his Misty didn't believe him due to things happening around him and left,so he wanted to test himself first what was his real nature was obsessively and all his abstract philosophical ideas and all now went to it’s climax the result of which is this Kalos returned language(all laugh)contradicting himself each moment to present a demon infornt of you only insinuating(laugh) that he is way beyond these(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly)...and you know he was hurt because he was so assured that i know him inside out and would be beside him no matter what he did and that's exactly the hells he was talking about.."
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,Mist i get it Ash did throw that Frontier trophy at me when i cornered him(all laugh) and said 10 years makes one(all laugh),just as much mad about you his soulmate and blind to anything else that is psychophysical including the idea of Mist as a being cause that’s Misty(laugh,Daisy too laughs,Misty smiles).."
Daisy(smile) : "yeah,just opposite to Mist as she was going everywhere only to thrash them apart mercilessly as soon as her Ash showed up in
them again and finally was left with nothing getting depressed till that very Ash showed up again,and this you know Mist,when he was piercing us through and through yesterday he said exactly this as an insult,as soon as he lays his first touch,you're running arter him without any
consideration whatsoever"
Misty(smile) : "truely Dase,only he could understand my problem and could do what he did..um..i don't know Dase,may be i was still way
better than his own condition,what he's doing around now is the actual playfullness that his soul and what he's all about and you can see how
irresistibly enticing and attractive it is now that he's just laughing off anything he ever did while self mortifying in a way that it just floods everyone away with him to playfullness,but what he had been doing everywhere before,i just got every bit of it yesterday,and you know all those hells he talked about,not only he himself went through all and wanted more and more so did he subject me to go through with him till he himself confessed that he can't beat me and can't shrug me off"
Lillie(concerned,hugging Mist) : "Mist,i was really scared you know as well as feeling that abject pain myself,i was really afraid that infact he
threatened us that even if Mist becomes insane after this,he can't be leagally harmed and all that,and we could sense what kind of monster he really had become and was only going to come at you with absolute all out to settle something that was disturbing him for a long time but you know as just 12 hours later he laughed all that off,i'm realizing monster or master(Misty smiles) he's an extremely honest guy even yesterday did only said point by point why he was hurting us citing what we might've ever done to him or to his mom and all that...and none were wrong at all..all those abstruse philosophy that his bunch was obsessively taught surely we realize now fully why they behave like this their master never told them he’s any different to them and viseversa and the scale was the most subtle thoughts humanly possible and that translator plan still all of us know the polish that produces that laguage via translators but his love for pokemons only is why his bunch is what they are never viewed tham as a being confined by psychophysicality and that includes you as well and i guess all do take May for example and she too similar(all smile) you the most cause of as he said soulmates(all smile)..”
Misty(smile) : “yeah Lil loves all of you as much as he feels the same about his bros here and May and Drew everyone can’t live without his family and to him either a professional teammate or family,his view of all of you are similar to mine as well his own elder sisters just like a bad tempered quarrel and Oliva and Irie ever said same to all of them just strictly professional,all family to him like what he so desperately wants that Gengar and sableye was doing in their most jovial way,don’t know what a friend is cause all are way closer than anything imaginable(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly)..”
Daisy(smile) : “yeah,Mist none would’ve said what he said last like in the way he did had he not known us to be his very own as well and Trace you know told me again today,once you know him you can’t leave him no matter what cause he doesn’t(all smile)..”
Lillie(smile) : “and just that is what is the tickling self by self as Gengar says,it’s just so much oneness that this language and antics are the only way to express the feelings(all smile,Misty kisses her ring again very fondly)..”
Misty(smile) : “and you know,he was at Undercover and there namecalled not males pulled same stunts on him many times that realled devastated me during his Unova period and all cause of surely none no matter how many and mastered by who or how many could beat Tyranitar alone what to speak of the whole bunch and hence this emotional backstabbing technique and this made him turn on this psychophysicality he ever so desperately tries to get away from from his late school days infact was a mere teenager then 20 years back or more and this along with everything that he was going thorugh since Unova,made my attitude to him seem similar to him that was his illusion so he just lost his Mist somewhere and hence just threw me off and 
 
Daisy(concerned) : "indeed Mist,now you're telling
us we can see why actually his fooling around and
making all us laugh everything off as well,this guy
is obsessive in his conviction that whatever his
soul is directing him to do,is true and right all the
time and its just that thing now in the form of
laughter overflooding us as merrily as the hellfire
did burn us mercilessly yesterday"
Misty : "you know,yesterday i cried like i never
knew as he was dragging me through every hell he
could come up with and much more than he
depicted today and i seriously felt i won't be able
to take it anymore,and in fact twice he calmed me
down by the help of his Pokemons (Daisy&Lillie
shivering hugs Misty)..(smile).. it's ok,he would've
gone with me as well no matter where it took him
to and you can see that he had the faith and it was
only me who wanted to walk with him..he took me
to unimaginable depths of hell and all the while
was carefully observing me whether i budge ornot,if he felt i really did budge he would've
instantly left me and himself became insane as he
would've realized even his Misty won't walk with
him everywhere,he would've become exactly like
what a pokemon is his in human body,a total
lunatic who only wanted to fool around...and even
after i was coming back again and again thrashing
all the fake copies he was creating to throw me
off..i really thought whether we'll end ever or not
given our own stubbornness and just only then did
i realize that he has become an absolute lunatic in
his obsession to go hell after till he destroyed
every ounce of sanity he ever had and it just didn't
feel to me like we could be stopped or wanted to
be stopped because i too had become mad in
thrashing all his hells and run after him to finally
get together it just didn't feel i wanted to stop
either as he himself didn't want to,later only
realized what i felt then was what he was
describing as come for me again and again
beyond death..i realized his actual call andobsession with himself to go beyond every death
and still continue to run never stopping and sanity
or insanity is a mere term there where he
went(tears,Daisy and Lillie too has tears in their
eyes) he wasn't Ash Ketchum at all anymore and
didn't care whether i was alive at all or he
himself,his being had crossed all limits and he
forgot himself forgot me forgot everything just
continuing his run as playfully as he is roaming
around now to where he didn't know, didn't want to
know but these too are only words to him,he had
become the very soul that we read and that cant
be described and was at a breakneck speed just
playfully with crackling laughter thay all his agony
had now become moving somewhere that none
can describe...this is poetic and we read only but
as you see your crying yourself (tears rolling down
everyone's cheeks) and then i found out that i too
am always travelling along with that playful march
of his soul forgetting any identity i ever knew-i
didn't know whether i was alive or dead orwhatever i myself wasn't Misty Waterflower
anymore as he was no more Ash Ketchum,i too
had become the soul thay he had become and
was equally playfully going just side by side as if
playing hide and seek with each other and my pain
and tears had also become crackling laughter just
like his,i just then felt eternally always with him
constantly just the same thing appearing as two
different entities to us(all cries,Misty in shivering
voice)but now about to merge together but
actually we didn't want to megre we wanted to
keep that separation keep that distance between
each other just to play that hide and seek eternally
like mere kids knowing nothing else,he was me,i
was him,we had no difference at all and we were
only as if mischeviously keeping that distance
only to fool around together always together and
nothing there was possible to describe our
relationship or anything,we had become the one
and absolute only fooling ourselves with this
appearing difference that we were projexting toenjoy ourself..in fact then i realized there was
never any Ash Ketchum or anything else at all it
was just me myself and Ash Ketchum was a thing
i myself had created to fool around with myself
and exactly to show me that was there ever any
Ash Ketchum at all and Ash Ketchum had just
shown me that...after this trace kinda state i came
back to my senses when i suddenly heard him
saying 'Misty, you must marry someone else and
have a good family forget a f.. like me whoose
hellbent of self destructing himself just because
he can' that word and idea of anything apart from
Ash Ketchum just pierced me so through and
through and then his self destruction which he
just had showed me to my own realization that
Ash Ketchum is nothing but Misty Waterflower,i
just couldn't take it anymore and screamed at him
that it's either him or bust for me he just laughed
at my face and that showed his own realization
that he went through just like me so many times
that he just knew even now he could play aroundwith me all he want and said the words that you
won't be able to imagi..he said 'if i f
.. around any random s.. would i still be f.. you
around?' ..you can understand what he just threw
with what kind of audacity and vulgarity at me as
if this world with anything what so ever had no
value whatsoever at all and he was ever the
carefree soul knowing he was totally immune to
anything that this world can ever imagine to throw
at him and this was the whole point he wanted to
show me for all these 17 years i guess which he
finally could with complete mastery and utmost
audacity which will throw anybody off except his
soulmate all while fully knowing exactly that,and
now was just as if knew my answer and just
fooling around with me as he knew himself his
Misty was not what was appearing before him but
has ever been and being and will be his very own
self-he himself-so he now decides to swear
around left and right with unimaginable
nonchalancy with me as if my appearance to himmeant absolutely nothing as he already knew and
had the true Misty Waterflower ever always with
him and will be...and these words along with my
realization made me understand that he was still
laughing at me with the the perfect knowledge
that his real Misty will eventually in just a matter
of moments pierce through the appearing Misty
and no matter what he did to the appearance and
Dase,when he said-i'll kill you and enjoy your slow
death and see if you want to die like that again
and again for me or rather get a moments chance
to be with me if the former assured an uncertain
but definite permanent union-he meant every word
of it as he himself had long surpassed any
limitations whatsoever so even if he was in this
world nothing really mattered to him at all...and at
this moment i just said yes he could never be not
but only ever be with me as he knows it himself
that i was only he himself(all crying)..this finally
appeased the devil and then with that same
nonchalancy and playfullness he proceededformally to define by word what he exactly showed
me first hand that the nothing could describe our
bond in between most appropriately except saying
that we're soulmates and now this again would
make us laugh out even in this state(tears,but
smiling,Daisy and Lillie stopped crying and looking
at Misty now),he finished it with probably the
greatest audacity you can imagine while at that
juncture as if all was just as he showed a mere
appearence and self illusion with you admitted
soulmate and even that that's the word he laughed
off as he knew he had just shown what he meant
so his appearance and behaviour or words never
matter thus he said that(mild laugh,with
tears,Daisy and Lillie closely looking at Misty not
crying a bit flustered,with faint smiles)Ash and
Misty are soulmates and this fact no vulture,be it
of Cerulian or(all laugh with tears) any other
godforsaken breed(now all laughing with less
tears)can ever do anything about no matter what
they insinuated(all laugh with tears of joy now)and then finally admitted to reconcile with me,only
after the declaration that even in his biggest all-or-
none juncture,all his steps and actions has thus
been rigourously proved so that(all laugh)no
Cerulian Brats and Vultures (all laugh out loud) no
matter what they insinuated to (all laugh again)
could ever prove the fact that Ash Ketchum wasn't
honest with himself(all laughs with tears)
Lil,Dase,first to me and now to us all,just as
jovially he made us cry to death has he made us
laugh to immortality,Ash Ketchum masterfully has
shown that no matter what the Cerulian Vultures
has ever insinuated to in their damn books(all
laugh again),Ash Ketchum by totally self
destructing himself has rather directly shown
anyone what soulmate really means"(everybody
bursts into tears of joy and laughter and engage in
group hug,claps)
(few moments later)
Misty(tears) : "and you know Dase,Lil when i was
giggling to him after this realization,Ash was eventhen still fooling around and his words were 'why
stupid b.. why are you laughing after going
through all hells completely losing every bit of
your chastity..soulmate,what a f.. word..stupid
b..',can you imagine these words even in that state
nonchalantly telling a girl he's about to get married
that she is a stupid b.. and doesn't have any
chastity?..(tears,smile)"
Lillie(shaking,sobbing) : "Mist,to anybody he can
just call the most chaste woman a b.. and the
viseversa and would still be equally adored by
them,he had just gone beyond any limitations one
can imagine...he has firmly proved that the
Vultures (all laugh) just can't even touch him"
Daisy(sobbing and laughs) : "Mist,I only wish this
could be written down or recorded but then
again Ash Ketchum then would've insinuated (all
laugh) just like what his immortal enemies (all
laugh) the Cerulian Vultures has done...(all laugh)
Lillie(tears,joy) : "and even now we being from
Cerulian itself,has he made us curse our ownbirthplace has as nonchalantly as he could swear
at his soulmate telling her she has no
chastity,even during reconciliation,to a woman he
laughs 'your unchaste' just before proposal and
she's loving every bit of it...(claps)..(all laugh and
smile and giggle)..Mist,you've known me and Dase
how nonchalant we were in our younger days and
saw many,but this is only very few can ever do just
sitting on the verge of complete destruction only
to laugh at the fact that he would still come back
no matter what...(tears).."
Misty(tears) : "to again and again prove that no
vulture would ever catch him or anyone else who
dared to follow him"(all tears and joy,clapping)
Misty,Daisy&Lillie(Unison, hugging each other) :
"Soulmate!"
(few moments later)
Misty(laugh) : "Trace hasn't still returned i guess
he's being again dragged through hells"(all bursts
into laughter)
Daisy(laughing) : No probably at the Lab,might bechecking all the pokemons(laugh) or just fooling
around as well..(all laugh)
Lillie(smile) : "and that little brat yesterday insulted
me with the same nonchalancy as when he came
back to patch up that no matter what one day we'd
still realize that Vultures could never tame him(all
laughs)"
Daisy(laugh) : "and before leaving would play a
nasty prank with someone who is most incensed
with him and just hours later all 3/4 years
difference would wipe out with a lecture ad around
last hours of a night...really,Mist you need to be
gazing him all time(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "Which he himself told his mom
to allow him to(all laugh)or else he'll snatch away
Mr Mime and battle him(laugh,others smile),said
'we have a deal here' as nonchalantly as you can
imagine(all bursts into laughter) and even to his
own mom he as audaciously as you can't imagine
said 'you have an idea about me and especially
your daughter'(laugh,Daisy and Lillie wonders)"Daisy(laugh) : "my god! what level of confidence
that nothing really matters"
Lillie(laugh) : "if mom and dad were here,he would
probably just as nonchalantly go and straight ask
them 'can i runaway with Misty to nowhere?(all
bursts) and somehow would've managed to do
exactly that(all bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laughing) : "i just can't believe that now we
just don't have any barriers what-so-ever between
any of us and can just about as well play around
to our extent and all the troubls that may come
would be thrown at any vulture(all laughs) to try
and meticulously get figured out while we enjoy
ourselves(all again laughs)"
Misty(laughing) : "and you know he didn't even
want to come here to apologize yesterday the first
place saying he doesn't need to,i send him
Forcefully,went out saying he'll be late as he has to
go revisit his farm plans and would be pretty
late,went to his beloved Cerulian(all laughes) gets
mobbed..and what a way to describe that aswell(laughs)
Daisy&Lillie(unison) : "go on,your beau in a half
day has created a mayhem that'll take an eternity
to digest and he's only getting started"(all laughs)
Misty(laughs) : "you know what they're thinking
about him,and he went to Cerulian on Gengar
having only Greninja as the cover..(Daisy and Lillie
laughs)..i told him to be bit cautious but now as
you see he just doesn't care at all and yes i'll force
him to be next time but the antics he did there..
(laugh).. according to him, Cerulian Mob thinks
1.he was the one to first reject the youngest flower
forcing her into severe depression
2.then he came back to humiliate her,which when
fuelled with the previous is pretty dangerous
then even more dangerously
3.he broke into her room trying to kidnap her and
try to reconcile which was thwarted by the flower
who due to security reasons had left for to Elite4
headquarters (all bursts laughter)
thus he proudly showed how he was the onecause due to which the Cerulian City has lost it's
last flower as well(all bursts into laughter) forcing
the famous gym to be shut down,all flowers
having left the city and finally the Sensational
Sisters also having been abruptly closed so
people are incensed and he was now their central
focus(all faint laugh)"
Daisy(feint smile) : "Mist,this is too dangerous you
know,having only two pokemons no matter how
strong they were and flying on Gengar.."
Lillie : "yeah don't let him next time.. anyhow say"
Misty(laughing) : "he said he actually played a card
to mitigate the anger there by resigning from Hall
of Fame,so the Cerulian brats(all smile) now think
finally this new pest to public peace(all bursts into
laughter) is depressed as our flower has finally
trodden over his chest(all laugh) rejecting
him(Misty shows the ring and all bursts into
laughter)..so,this new meance now having been
totally distraught has lost his mojo and went into
depression and thus resigned (all laugh) so hegoes to the police station asks for protection by
threatening them that unless he got protection
quickly (laugh) he'd shoplift(all bursts into
laughter) at this specific address(all bursts into
laughter again)
Lillie(laugh) : "Mist,this is just insane..(all again
laughs)"
Misty(laughing) : "so now he goes to Mr Keller and
he describes his appearance to the Cerulian Mob
as(all laugh)
'but then appolocalype approachs(all bursts into
laughter),
suddenly that brat appears off the blue/in all
smiles with his sinister crew(all bursts into
laughter)/to get to a shop as if to get his due(all
laugh)/suddenly he declares a ring for his beau(all
uncontrollably laughs)"
Daisy(laughing) : "Ash Ketchum really has become
a new pest to personal space as well...(all bursts
into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "then according to him theCerulians say->
'what a night this comrades Cerulian/we must
very first get rid of this evil king demon(all
laugh)/so comrades lets come and challenge to
this man/force him show what he hides below his
tan'(all bursts into laughter)
Lillie(laughs) : "and he only had Greninja as fresh"
Misty(laughing) : "they mob him and accuse him
of abducting the youngest flower and insinuate
(all bursts into laughter) that the Gym,the Sisters
and the Show all gone due to him,infact not one
but he has abducted all the four flowers(all bursts
into laughter) to which he challenges them 50 on
1 with Greninja all at a time"
Daisy&Lillie(awestruck) : "my god!what if.."
Misty(laugh) : "his logic is that the more pokemon
the more illusion over his ability"
Daisy(concerned) : "really Mist,you have to lease
him well(all laughs)..this is too much"
Misty(laughs) : "yeah,i'll but just look at his
nonchalancy just hours after going through allhells to get his soulmate and then all of your
stares and all..just laughs at everything and then
as the number confused them and he said
Greninja isn't found naturally in Kanto so more
confusion,is the meantime he placed the order(all
bursts into laughter)
Lillie(laughing) : "this is just classic"(all laugh)
Misty (laughing) : "then he retorts them why were
they so angry and then appeases them by saying
Cerulian has best diamonds in the world so where
would he go, buying himself the time to deal in the
shop(all laughs again),then the mob retorts all
their accusations,tonwhich and now(laugh) please
help..he says what do you people want the Sisters
or the Performance show(all bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "this was said to a ferocious mob
just about to jump on him with one pokemon and
limited police in that short space...and this time
that he bought,he proceeded with the shopping..
(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "this according to him made themob absolutely confused then he showed them
some Greninja balance tricks all tricks and finally
dispersed them completely by saying if they mob
him and hold him up,his fiancee wont appreciate
the Cerulian people(shows the ring and all bursts
into laughter) as much as their diamonds(all
bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "then he came here to apologize (all
laughs even more)"
Misty(laughing) : "and he assured them that he
had nothing to do with the gym leader he just
thought he could help and so on and said she'll
back probably holidaying somewhere brunt out
overworking and so on(shows her ring again,all
laugh) and before leaving gave them the ultimate
advise that no matter how electrifying darling of
masses may the sisters has been(all laugh) they
have to also settle down and have a nice family(all
laugh) and whether their own beloved fans won't
spare them even for this bit(all laughs) which is
his sentiment card that totally decimated the moband he came he with flying colours(all bursts into
laughter"
Daisy(laughing) : "this just keeps getting better
and better (all laugh) he even managed to give an
insurmountable defense for us as well..Mist,long
live Pokemon Master"(all bursts into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "then he brutally slaughtered all
of you(laughs)"
Lillie(laugh) : "know evem that would do go on.."
Daisy(laugh) : "we can't mind anymore at all"
Misty(laugh) : "he said first Daisy doesn't allow
him to enter(Daisy laughs),then calls him b.. all the
time(all laugh),then when he finally calms her
down with how he only tried to judge her baby
sister only etc she finally budges and in the
meantime Trace comes out to gauge(all laugh)
the situation but eats a death glare from Daisy(all
laugh) and doesn't come into any help to him as
usual as he has always pestered him whenever he
got his flower alone(all bursts into laughter) since
Orange Islands(all laughs even more),then Daisygives him merching order telling him to at that
time of night don't use her as a shiled to protect
himself from infidelity that too on his first night(all
smiles,Daisy shakes her head) as if unless she
told he would've exactly done that(all laugh) which
made Daisy to return basking in her glorious
victory (all bursts into laughter) while dragging
poor Tracey with her as she thought is influence
has already corrupted her husband(all bursts into
laughter) by every means(all laugh)
Daisy(laugh) : "he has even made me laugh with
this as well"
Misty(bit concerned) :"but um.."
Lillie(laugh) : "go on my child has got enough
recreation for the entire life already"(all bursts into
laughter)
Misty(laugh) : "Gary is jealous of him for taking
away his bad boy championship(all laughs) but
quickly cools down as he hears his now well
polished defence(all laugh) only to be sent to the
lionesses (Lillie laughs hard) who was the biggestthreat(all laugh) to his eventual marriage (all
bursts into laughter)..then he says that the
lionesses directly junps to prey upon him by again
calling him names and whatnot while he says that
at this time she should take rest which the
lionesses brushes aside by accusing he'll cheat on
her baby Mist that night itself(all laughs) oh and
by the way Daisy also told him that he threatened
her baby Mist to reconciliation(all laughs) now the
lionesses continues to her victory march depicting
how much he has fallen pauses to bite him saying
he'll definitely leave her sister and finally goes to
the end by stating he has no chance of
reconcilation with anyone to which he all the while
says that she must take care of herself and then
finally dragging Gary's name in he tames the
lionesses (Lillie bursts into laughter)(all laugh) but
still she paws him by giving the marching orders
while reminding him of the root to his just wed
wife as if otherwise he would've lost the way(all
laughs uncontrollably),then as he comes out,thelion jumps upon him to politely bark him(all bursts
into laughter) to his grandpa,who was waiting
patiently for his turn which was unfortunately he
on the day(all bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laughing) : "this no comedy can ever give
you,Ketchum has really caught us all(all bursts
into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "he says he had to be extra
careful to lick the boots of the old bear(all laughs)
so that he doesn't have to transfer all his
pokemons that night itself playing the childhood-
home and humility-despite-fame card that rather
appeases the professor but he beaks his head off
questioning about his pokemons and whatnot (all
bursts into laughter) which on the backdrop of his
Cerulian adventure is the most boring anticlimax
(all bursts into laughter) anyway he somehow
manages to get out only to be absolutely incensed
to realize that that very momnet,the gentleman-
looking-most-cunning fox named Trace(all
uncontrollably laughs) is dreaming in the Orangeof Oranges with his flower(Daisy laugs out loud)
while he was toiling hard to even get to his own
flower this realization angers him extremely (all
laugh) so he tells Gengar to fetch the brat
immediately (all laughs uncontrollably) which he
tickllly obliges(all bursts into laughter) as the
sweet sweet fox(all bursts into laughter) comes
out he doesn't know which side to sail to(all
laughs) only managing to fire out the why drag all
in bullet which by then he repeated so many times
that he got angrier(all laughs) and fired in the
canonball that all he wanted to do was to check
the chemistry before parade(all laugh,Daisy
shakes her head) which this fox wickedly shields
(all laughs) by saying that they'll not be his flower
but follow suit always which stuns him so much
that he resorts to the embrace-it-out option(all
laugh) meanwhile Daisy again comes out with fhe
groundbreaking declaration that she had
evsdropped them(Daisy bursts into laughter,others
follow suit) which as if was unknown to him(allbursts into laughter) and declares that why he was
back whether he had spoken to yer younger
lionesses (all bursts into laughter) etc to which he
continues the sentiment card which Daisy doesn't
think she can handle for long(all bursts into
laughter) thus tries to pull off his own trick on
him(all laughs) by selling him the same wisdom
nut he had earlier sold her(all bursts into laughter)
saying that alright she admitted her baby Mist
went to him intentionally and would roam around
him all her want for the rest of her life(Misty
laughs,others smile)but she shouldn't suffer for
her devotion (all smile) which he rather ducks
out(all laughs) but is again incensed again seeing
her crooked man(all laughs) was enjoying his
death all the while smirking and thinking of the
final attack that'll absolutely nail him down(all
bursts into laughter),so to foild Daisy again from
dragging him inside(Daisy laughs) he uses him to
insinuate (all bursts into laughter) that his actions
endangered his pokemons which this wicked foxjokes out(all laugh) and makes a comeback by
advising him to phone around all from Brock to
God(all laughs uncontrollably) which he then
somehow bypasses only to be so incensed as this
constant hindrence having pestered him for 15
hears whenever he wanted to adore his flower in
complete seclusion(all laughs) and even today
was upto his old tricks(all bursts into laughter)he
using Gengar again creates an illusion to play a
prank on Brock of all people who was most
incensed with him and viseversa for trying to
detach hia flower from him(all laughs)..by-the-
way,sweet sweet Brock(all laughs) is in a real
danger now which his sweet sweet Trace(all
laughes) got into today again as he was hugging
his flower(Misty blushes, other two smirks)
snatching her away from the kitchen threatening
his mom of robbing her pokemon (all bursts into
laughter) and his 15 year long nemesis again had
to choose the exact same time(all bursts into
laughter) to insinuate that(all again laughes) hewas his flowers BEST choice(all laughs
uncontrollably) which as usual he started with
sweeting the man only to call a false alarm and
forcing everyone out of the home with the
intention to have the grand lunch here today(all
bursts into laughter) and has probably showed
Trace all kinds of hell that he didn't show me and
rigourously proved to him about one being-two
appearance-only for the illusion to break theory
unless he truely has killed him(all bursts into
laughter) which he will do as he now possibly has
come to know the intricate details of each of
those damn brats(all laughs) that had the audacity
to even look at his flower(all bursts into laughter)
while he wasn't (all bursts into laughter) which
includes unmarried females as well(all laugh) as
due to him this brand if young has always been a
constant problem for him(all bursts into laughter)
to handle and according to him they tried many
pranks to get his attention off from his flower(all
bursts into laughter) as well as the threat that theymight've influenced his flower rubbing her the
wrong way(all laughs uncontrollably) so Brock
being a constant encouragement of such brats(all
laughs),his time is really numbered(all bursts into
laughter) though hopefully in the last hours of
night Trace of all people again to his utter
disdain(all laughs) had the audacity to call him
and insinuate (all laughs) that his actions weren't
right(all laugh)..and you know thank God that i
snatched his phone away otherwise he would've
again set Gengar upon on you(all laughes) and
this was after he could give the ring(smile,blush)
which if wasn't the case Trace would've been in
such hellfire that no vulture(all laugh) ever
could've insinuated him out of it(all bursts into
laughter)...then Trace rather idiotically forces her
flower to compell him to call Brock to God(all
laugh) at that time of night,and already these little
Vultures insinuating around him if weren't
enough(all bursts into laughter) only for him now
they had their dirty eyes on his flower's beautynap(all bursts into laughter) as well,so this sends
him right into hell(all bursts into laughter) and i
somehow managed to dissuade him from
appearing on Gengar in Brock's bed that very
night(all bursts into laughter) and that too having
known that even on that day Brock had the
audacity to not only doubt him but directly causing
his flower some pain on her first night by
insinuating (all laughs) her that he doesn't quite
understand it,and this had put him out of his mind
absolutely and he wanted to personally empty the
whole Oak Lab pokémons on Cerulian and
Brock(all bursts into laughter) and possibly on the
whole world(all bursts into laughter) or may be
alert the whole Elite4 to crush every vulture(all
laugh) that ever appeared on Cerulian sky that
day(all bursts into laughter) but he would've
absolutely loved to completely devour sweet
sweet Brock(all laughs) himself and i barely
managed to calm the Gyarados of Gyradoses
down(all bursts into laughter) only to tell him tophone-it-out(all laughs),which he obliged and
started with telling Brock that he expected more
help from males than females during his
separation (all bursts into laughter) which to his
utter disdain turned out to be the exact
opposite(all bursts into laughter) making him
absolutely loath every being on the planet apart
from his mom and flower(all bursts into
laughter),as Brock tried to make a sentimental
comeback saying he hadn't spoken for 3/4
years,he just thunder chaired him off(all bursts
into laughter) saying whether Brock was
insinuating that(all laugh) he needed to announce
to the world his longing for his beau(all laughs
absolute uncontrollably)"
(few moments later,Misty lying down still has a fit
of laughter,Daisy also laughes aloud,as we as
Lillie)
Daisy(laughing) : "then Brock still had the audacity
to challenge him to a rigourous insinuate-it-out(all
bursts into laughter) which truely made sweetsweet Brock(all bursts into laughter) his biggest
ever singular enemy ever imaginable(all again
laughs)"
Misty(laughes) : "then suddenly Brock decided to
connect with sweet sweet Viol of all people...(all
bursts into laughter)..who started with screeching
him names to which he politely pointed out that
it'll only harm her song performances (all
uncontrollably laughs) which startled Viol so
much that she(all laugh)said why was he not
sleeping then(all bursts into laughter) to which he
scoffed to Viol of all people that her beau was
feeling lonely (all uncontrollably laughs) which
again incensed Viol so much that she was about
to go overdrive and just as she thundered the first
b..(all laugh) he politely pointed out that at that
moment the b.. is trying to dissuade Misty flower
form attacking him(Misty blushes,others pat
her)..which truely threw Viol off her track(all
laughes uncontrollably) buying him the time(all
laugh) to growl at Brock why was he so incensedabout the fact that he called him a lunatic un.. l.. r..
Infront of his then beau(all shakes their heads)
and showed some fake documents (all
shivering)..no wait this is what makes him the
Pokemon Master,as he fired these two both Viol
and Brock went into overdrive,in the meantime he
came back to quickly adore his flower once
more(Misty blushs and laughs,others
laugh),reminding his flower to not let the
gentleman-fox(all Laughs) and his sinister
flower(all laughs,Daisy Laughs out loud) mingle
longer with her.(all laughs uncontrollably) and
return to Brock to God to Viol(all laugh) that as he
was saying(all laughs) he only did Viol the
Greatest service of her life..and um..Dase this is
what we've been wondering about that how can he
be proved right even in this case..which utterly
stops Viol as Brock then tries to make a
insinuating comeback(all laugh) that what was he
upto with Misty,to which he scoffs that why was
he upset that while he gave Brock the chance topick Viol flower which he happily obliged,Brock of
all people never gave him the chance to pick up
his Misty flower,then as all was totally silent
including God to Viol(all laughs) he growled at Viol
that he sweared her husband out of his slumber
for all wrong flowers to make him realize the right
one and now Viol flower was insinuating (all
laugh) to him that he will tear apart Misty
flower,whom he has gone through so many hells
to get to(all smile),at which though Viol Flower
didn't like this constant flower business (all
uncontrollably laughs) anymore,she had to admit
that she's so happy with Brock(all bursts into
laughter) to Brocks abject failure to swear at the
Pokemon Master..(all laughs)...now that Brock to
God to Viol Flower all having calmed down the
master played the master trick telling Viol to take
rest as she had to fly out that very
morning(astonished)..no i didn't know either how
he guessed that,to which he later told that a
perfectionist like Viol when it comes to herperformance would always be calmed down with
that enough to get herself concentrated again by
being distracted(all laughs) so he played a guess
and suddenly that turned out to be right as he also
thought otherwise Viol being Voil won't stay
awake at that time unless she had a plane to
catch the very morning being a perfectionist (all
bursts into laughter),the he himself sweet talked
Viol off saying his pathetic 17 year journey(all
laugh) has made himself rather detached from the
world of art(all bursts into laughter) which he
would like to rekindle may be sometimes later(all
laugh) with the addition that he has travelled the
whole world but whether Brock thought this
Mantine(all bursts into laughter) was the most
artistic (all bursts into laughter) to this Brock was
dumbfounded (all laugh) as Viol was very happy
and went on to tell Brock how sweet her Mantine
was(all laugh),then congratulated Ash on his title
and Misty flower and got disconnected(all laugh)
then he sweared Brock left and right basicallytelling him that a half-grown brat(all laugh) like
him should've been the first to realize his heart-
wrenching pain for his flower(all smiles,Misty
blushs,giggles) and he did the exact opposite only
by encouraging underground sludge to flow upto
the ground and try desparately to reach his
flower,and some portion of which had the audacity
to challenge him during his Unova Elite4 battle by
insinuating something(all shake their heads)..no
Dase this is the only time i saw him angry and you
won't like to face it as yesterday just after he
started to torture me i saw that same fire in his
eyes when he instructed his pokemons to snatch
mine away and if any brat human or pokemon
disturbed him today despite Pikachu being
there,he threatened his bunch to forsake them
forever (all very concerned)..he told them not to
kill any persons but if there were any pokebrat(all
smile) misbehaving including mine,then to
mercilessly kill them off(all shivering)after the first
warning and he engaged his 4 pokemons to makesure i don't have a heart attack or faint or any
discomfort(all shivers) which um..well...Bulbasaur
and all else were excellent and he sleep powdered
me just at the right times and just enough to make
myself calm down while i could hear and
congnize,a pokemon did that like the most
professional doctor(all wonder)..which he later
said Bulbasaur being the eternal guardian to all,
understood to some extent from body movements
and inferred condition of humans now that he was
always beside Gary as well,so he trusted him on
this,and Bulbasaur behaved just like a
human,which actually is Ash's biggest strength
that he knows he has atleast one of the 85 beings
beside him all the time including Mime,that would
be beside him till infinity (all smile)he told me
many times that they too were his soulmates(all
smile, hugging Misty)...then i saw what sort of
height pokemon master's pokemons has reached
all did things like a well trained Military with
Snorlax bossing around the area and he was fromorange and yeah he gave Ash the Hoenn league
but only then isaw the might of him,that adorable
snoring sleeping round teddy bear looked like he
has gobbled up the whole world and has become
its gurdian and sole responsibility.. and truely Lil,
that little sweet Pikachu that plays around no
matter what he did in Sinnoh or Kalos,this
Pikachu's was just burning as if nothing in the
world could go past him that day no matter who
they were or how many and as if he had become
Ash himself,then that devillish determination to
the goal to obey his master no matter what...(all
wonder and shiver)..and the whole other lab
pokemons were so disciplined and this was itself
a false alarm as he told me..(all wonder)...as he
later casually laughed it off saying Snorlax's
concern and Pikachu's rage was enough for the
rest of his own to follow suit and the others to
properly behave all the while Bulbasaur and his
Dark gang worked upon me without being
disturbed by anything outside as if they'veforgotten everything except me..Bulbasaur looked
after me just as any professional doctor would do
and his 3 dark types were at my nerves and
somehow made myself feel a bit light just as i saw
them each time as if they were trying to tell me
why are you so concerned?you'll get through this
and then we'll play around all we want...after each
of his hellrounds one by one mercilessly tore my
body apart...well,um..he started with swearing me
then completely scoffed
away..um..purity(Daisy&Lillie shivers)...Dase,what
he did to me mentally and verbally,no h.. b... would
be able to do that in their wildest dreams
physically,he tore apart every bit of my body
simply by swearing them off then came to my
mind where every idea of kindness etc he
mercilessly attacked...you can realize now what
he was doing (all smile)..he just was desperately
trying to take my focus away from body and
sentiments and emotions to the soul and in the
same process i was watching what he was doingto himself he was just thrashing himself to death
before me and waiting for me to follow suit all the
while his pokemons were robotically doing what
they were told to...and i finally had my moment
and we finally patched up when his jovial real self
came out and that did what it did(all smile),that
torture..unless one himself have gone through it
several times and knows every bit of can subject
another to that..and he was swearing me left and
right to insult me at the same time he sweared me
even more only to remind me that i had the
strength to follow suit and he knows it...he had
more faith in me than myself which actually..um..
(blushes)
Daisy(smile,patting Misty) : "your own faith in his
abilities when he first started out,just repayed you
that(Misty giggle and blush)"
Lillie(smile) : "truely a Pokemon Master"
Misty(blush) : "yeah that's what he told and you
know why he told that and i just realized what Ash
Ketchum had become...just like in PokemonWorld,he doesn't have any match in this world
when it comes to control over his neves even
when as he was dying and on that of any
Pokemons...he in the meantime battled me to
show his power,i was incensed enough myself,he
got Gyarados of all for me,and used Bulbasaur
who just stood there like a statue looking at
Gyarados,who to my then worst nightmare..you
know the best that in my own powers, Gyarados
was just like the Master's Pokemons if not more
and that Gyarados despite me screaming my head
off to flamethrow Bulbasaur,kept looking at
Bulbasaur and Ash,then looked at me as if she
couldn't believe why she was out of the Pokeball
itself,then just calmly lied down beside me,and i've
barely seen her lie down and she did it while on
the ground,which she hasn't than more than once
or twice before...i was scared to death as i
couldn't believe my most trusted sweetie just left
me at that moment..to which Ash just smiled and
came and tendered her..and even at that point isaw,he was still the same playfull kid to Gyarados
as ever,and my Gyarados looked at him with the
same care that she has ever done to me if not
more...then Ash recalled her again and that sweet
tender Ash of mine whom i just couldn't help but
to fell for since the first sight(all tender Misty),just
in a moments notice went to the next devillish hell
and Bulbasaur nonchalantly returned to tender me
as if nothing ever happened for Ash only later
telling me,if he pushed himself to the limits he
could control lenegdary pokemons at his will as
well but not for a long time and he was at that
moment hismself torturing him to death as well
and then on my Gyarados of all pokemons,he just
tamed her as if she was his soulmate too(all
tears)...and i saw then his real power and slowly
realized that none could rescue me from this
demon except myself(smile,all else smile) and
just went on;none can reach it unless he's
ferociously honest with himself that he can never
harm any pokemons or their trainers no matterwhat his words and behaviour were and he told
me if that was my Goldy, Goldy probably would've
hugged him to death as he knew him personally
for a long time..my Goldy would've been so
assured no matter what was happening to me that
he would cuddle my oppressor and it's lunatic in
normal condition but if Gyarados could do
that,Goldy could certainly do that(all shiver and
smile)..he told me his only concern when it comes
to My pokemons is Dewgong as he is the Gym's
leader pokemon,he Ash can't tame psychologically
no matter what,but i was only happy cause no
matter how strong Dewgong is,he would've been
totally torn apart by the whole Lab pokemons that
day if he didn't budge at Bulbasaur's first
warning,as i only later came to know that he
wisely gave me Gyarados and not Dewgong,cause
he himself would have been able to stop all but
Pikachu if Dewgong attacked Bulbasaur as
Pikachu just about turned to Gyarados but
Noivern,who was closely observing Gyarados,hedidn't come close as Noivern signalled him that
Gyarados isn't misbehaving,you can imagine what
level his pokemons are at and all Bulbasaur did
was to signal Gyarados that,Ash was trying to help
me calm down only(smile,all smile),Lil,Dase when
later he told me his pokemons are his soulmates i
realized what he meant,it is a fully trained
unmatched battelion except Pikachu and Mime
who would go to any hell with him,Mime was
spared for his Mom,though she can herself
become pretty insanely unstoppable with all her
psychic powers cause she alone has to defend
Mrs Ketchum if she wished so and Pikachu's
temperament is that he is Ash's big brother(all
smile),so he would rather look after him than to
follow him(laugh,rest smile) and this itself made
him most dangerous to anything that Ash felt any
threat from.."
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,Gary said he has never seen
anything like a phenomena Pikachu has
become,because Ash wont battle him again he'supset and thinks his 'lil bro has gone to the
bushes(all laugh loudly) so he won't talk with him
much(all laugh hard), that's why he keeps a bit
distance from Ash since he has returned.."
Daisy(laughing) : "well he threatened his sweet
sweet Trace today with Pikachu right Mist?(all
laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "the moment he heard Trace,he
screamed Thunder Chair(all laugh)..and Pikachu
threatened Trace like nothing(all laughs).."
Daisy(laugh) : "it's unbelievable that how those
little pests can threaten or fondle anybody
according to Ash's will and yet mean no harm,the
first time he came back,as soon as Trace
pronounces "Mist" he bursts into "Thunderbolt"
and Pikachu scared Gary and Trace to death by
jumping on Trace only to scratch his nose(all
laugh)politely(all laughs uncontrollably)"
Lillie(laugh) : "right,later we were told unless Ash
really means it,Pikachu won't even attack a single
pokemon but Ash's only concern is that if Pikachuis with him and someone puches him and
something and he gets angry and gets involved
but the opposition is more powerful or more in
number for the Master to insinuate himself out(all
laugh) and getting angrier and feeling physically
threatened during a long skirmish,then if Pikachu
is with him or near him or somebody brings him to
Ash,even Ash can't stop Pikachu from thunder
chairing the whole world(smile)Grandpa' said
there's no record of a Pokemon being able to
judge his Master and even boss him around like
Pikachu can do,so Ash calmed the brat(all smile)
down saying he's done many things for a long
time why doesn't he take rest at home(all laugh)
and at the same time insinuating that Pikachu(all
laugh) has become too lazy and wants to drink too
much(all laugh) so Pikachu also got angry and
conspiring with Mime and Gengar(all laugh) eat all
his food, tickled him whole day whenever they
caught him,and pestered him the whole night(all
laugh),so the two brothers aren't on good terms(alllaugh) though they're too professional (all laugh)
to bring their personal matters(all laugh) to their
business partnership (all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "mom was insinuating (all laugh)
that if Gengar and those other two sinister dark
devils(all laugh) has done something to Ash(all
laugh) as she isn't fond of Gengar(all laugh) as he
pesters her as usual(all laugh) and Mime is too
disobedient while Ash is around(all laugh),Pikachu
isn't talking with Ash(all laugh) and the other two
unknown Devils that Ash has got straight from
hell(all laugh) doesn't seem to have saintly
motives(all bursts into laughter)..to which i told
her a bit of Ash's supremely heightened ability and
nerve control,to which she opined that he must be
lonely then(all bursts into laughter),giving Ash the
golden chance to re-insinuate(all laugh) her that
she herself has just admitted that he can even
infront of his mom adore his flower(Misty blushes,
others pat her)"
Daisy(laughing) : "..all he wants and making a dealwith Mrs Ketchum that unless he gets to fondle
his sweet sweet flower all the time,Mime is going
to circus(Misty blushes,others smirk and pat) with
his sworn-in(all laugh) enemy,the gentleman-
crook(all bursts into laughter)"
(few moments later)
Misty:"then after calming down Gyarados he again
went on to torture me...and so on..anyhow when
he looked that way scoffing at Brock,i felt scared
to which he just pat my head(blush,rest smile) and
told me that it was again his trash talking that'll
work,which did...Brock got infuriated to start that
game which was exactly what he dragged Brock
to and then you know the rest(all smile)..and
about the sludges he told me that they went to
Unova and no he never wanted to know about
them or why they had come but could see them
that they had some personal problems with him
and they suddenly challenged him just before his
E4 match as he out of irritation scoffed at
them,which he calmly accepted just for Kingler tononchalantly adore the sludge brands biggest
strength Slobro to gleefully submit as if Slobro
was her long lost best friend,and as sludges
couldn't believe what they just saw and,the public
glare eventually lightened upon dark sludges for
disturbing the Elite4 challenger who was a
budding once ever enigma with his Kalos win
itself..and sluges were such buffoons that they
thought they could beat all Elite4 with with their
lackies just because they won Kanto and Orange
around retirement (scoff)...sludges being a well
known enough for the stench emanating,it took
Ash some trouble but still he managed to utterly
fool around with Unova Elite4 in all departments
and saved the sludges from public humiliation by
changing their names and so on..yup Pokemon
Master made his biggest enemies his absolute
pets in no time by humility, actually triggering my
depression to that worst turn only for he himself
to rescue me(fondles her ring and Giggle,all group
hug)..oh and on our first night he again praised thesludges that went to challenge him to
Unova,saying he in that position would've done the
same but he then just complained that the
boneheads should've realized that not many
people can win 6 leagues and then the last one
with that kind of utmost nonchalancy and
playfullness and that too after winning all 32
badges of that Region,(proudly)22 Badges in
Unova,11 in Sinnoh,(kisses her ring fondly)winning
the final as 1 vs 8,and these all are much later,my
Ash even before this has won 2 leagues and battle
frontier(kisses her ring) with a few contest ribbons
as well,and the boneheads did what they did...Ash
said that they should've realized that may be none
ever has fooled around in a league Final and just
laughing his challenger off to defeat(fondly kisses
her ring)...all these none has ever done this and
they can't from unless they were very honest to
the core(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly
again),thus the sludges didn't need to be
concerned about their beaus's former crushes atleast as long as it was about him no matter what
the press told about him,even if he had fondled
the sludge's beau ever,he has no jealousy about it
and won't pester his honeymoon at all(angry,
others tender Misty)..and Dase,Lil,actually i
realized what a disservice the sludges did to both
of us,after that he praised the sludges to heaven
for winning Kanto,which he himself could only
reach upto the last 16(all smile)..(in a proud,tense
voice) without telling the sludges that it was only
Master's very first and even with his catterprie the
Master would've sludged the sludge's sludge
slobro on the very second day of his journey in his
sleep...(Misty kisses her ring fondly,other tenders
Misty,calm voice broad and proud smile)and he
even congratulated the sludges for being a two
league champions and atleast having the guts to
stand up for their beau(shivering voice,others
smile) no matter how tough a hurdle Ash Ketchum
posed(smile,tears,others pat Misty)...praising the
sludges again,now he bore the dirt thrown yetsaving the sludges from Elite4 wrath and public
humiliation..then the sludges still don't know what
a grave mistake they committed,it could've been
that very moment they could've been thunder-
chaired to their adorable dreams(shivers)..by
stating that they were straight from Cerulian
seaweage...(shiver)..as they were so greatful that
they wanted to be f.. around like all those h..b..
waiting at his feet all the time..(angry,tears,all pats
Misty).(smile,Misty kisses her ring very fondly
again)..and look at the Master's heart even then,he
complemented him saying he expected this from
a Cerulian and that too being a two league
champion and the City was near Pallet his respect
has only increased to meet some real sludges like
them straight from Cerulian drains(all laugh)..
(laugh).. though now we know all about it..(all
laugh)...but i didn't understand it when the sludges
returned and again was trying to stench my gym
went so overboard just cause they were given the
opportunity by the Master to have a coffee,thetthey went on insinuating me if they were me they
would've thrown themselvs at the Master's feet all
the time...(tears,kissing her ring again,all pats
Misty)...no,Dase,Lil,after all this i can tell you why
exactly i got so depressed and this was it...and the
reason was the Master himself,and Ash started to
torture me and just mouth off my purity from
exactly this point(tears,again kisses her ring
fondly)...i then just realized what Ash mercilessly
told me yesterday that he had me for 13 years and
had my whole mind and body totally scanned and i
of all didn't need to hide anything from him just
like he himself,we grew up together(kissing the
ring)..he never bothered about any physical
closure with me despite knowing my devotion for
him(sobbing)..and you yourself know what he
says here...he told me that he was infatuated with
me,attracted to me,and no neither did i ever notice
anything except may be he kept his hands on my
shouldrs a bit too long or held my hands a bit too
long or gazed my face a bit too long withadoration...(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly
again)..and that's all.he just liked to pass time
alone with me that's all.and there too,never went
overboard about any compliments at all except
the 'you look cute' or when he was my boyfriend
would just pat my hands while saying that and
that's all...he never hugged me in any other way
than a good friend does,not even when he was my
boyfriend,not even the day we had our first
kiss(tears,kisses her ring adorably, others
pat)...never any more than that despite me only
being his one nod away from getting all over him
and especially all the time i saw him after his
sinnoh miracle...and all we ever did then was to
have one kiss,and that too he yesterday said was
all his fault if he got weak like a h.. b..yeah said it
to himself..that day and couldn't keep to himself
despite me not wanting that but may be ultimately
agreeing to cause i got too emotional and he said
may be he shamelessly took a chance on my
warmth for him(tears,kisses her ring)...and he wasmy boyfriend,he knew how much i wanted him,still
apologized yesterday if i wasn't in the mood that
day and he was a shameless.."
(tears,kisses her ring,others tears,pats her)
Lillie(tears) : "Mist,i've now realized what he told
me yesterday and why he was so nonchalant
about it that he didn't even bother to appologize,he
knew what me and Gary meant to each other and
he knew the past and he hit that point only to see
if we'd still believe him to be just fooling around or
not..we never would but i get his point now...if it
was so strong why would you be too emotional no
matter what,which i was..just laugh it off some
times later.it's still within family and all knew who
you were including grandpa...(sobbs)..and we've
known each other for so so many years that yes
we've found our soulmates but its still at the end
an extremely unique bond that we share may be
even more than a family and that's why nothing
can topple it,nothing none would be bothered
about,we are just too known too each other thateven the very private life never mattered just that
we don't need to rigourously talk about it and
that's all,Mist you can realize when he went on to
the comparisons,he broke apart anything we
might ever have felt about others in our darkest
and weakest days,but now we were way ahead,but
if that wasn't yet cleared,the master would
insinuate-it-out(all laugh)...(smile)that little brat
trash talked us to his beloved hellfires to break any
barrier that he felt were insinuating (all tears and
laugh) something by totally mortifying himself and
yes if he does that again we'll do the same but..if
you get me..."
Daisy(sobbing) : "he tore himself apart from us
solidifing our bond by killing off any unimaginable
Cerulian sludge(all tears,laugh) who may ever dare
to vulture around(all smile)outside on in our mind
itself due to the past and the unique bond...all the
while we loathed him to absolute hell,he just
sweard off any reservations we could ever
imagine"Lillie(smile) : "no we don't imagine that and that
brat should've known it(all laugh) but he
mercilessly thunder-chaired all unimaginable
vultures(all smile) that made his own life a living
hell,even before they dared to come into existence
even mentally,especially as our children would
grow up and new staffs would come in and all
that...a change of guard...and most glaringly and
that was his point he was about to do that
himself,our soilmates would only get closer and
closer..and all darkness would be sweared off to
hellfire rounds where he would go too..(all
laugh)that little obsessive self-destructive pest
indeed is a new meance to personal space"(all
bursts into laughter)
Daisy(smile) : "and this same thing he did to
Brock,and now look at him...for all his qualities the
vulture-killer(all laugh) sweared off his one mental
barrier without knowing what it was but just doing
enough insinuattion(all laugh) to Brock to
insinuate-it-out(all laugh) himself...Mist,we needyour beau as well(all bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and even if he went to hell
yesterday,and many years later any vulture(smile)
suddenly appeared in our wildest dreams,we
would remember that merciless swearing-in
ceremony (all laugh) so that the Vultures will
again be proved that truely nowhere can they ever
catch the Pokemon Master..(all bursts into
laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "Mist,in your trance travelling as
soul,next time remember Vultures are always
there(all bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "especially the godforsaken Cerulian
breed(all again bursts into laughter)"...
(all laughs for a few moments)
Misty(smile) : "but you know he then told the
sludges that their girlfriends were in safe hands
and he wished them luck(all smile)..this he told
me at night,so then i realized why those sludges
was so overjoyed that day...(smile)....and
Dase,Lil,even yesterday,even after giving me,hissoulmate the engagement ring for which he totally
mortified hismself for so long,but then making me
feel his eternal wife just in hours,my Ash still told
me that if he never came,i would've been in safe
hands(tears, kisses her ring fondly,others pat
Misty)"
Daisy : "really Mist,the sludges are really lucky that
they ever even had a chance to meet a person like
this"
Lillie : "yeah,and hopefully it gives them a better
life"
Misty (tears,smile) : "and also after i got to know
his pokemons powers over nerves his own powers
etc and this is after i got my ring, suddenly as if
something had bitten him,some memory,he just
forced me away from him and fervently
apologized that if i ever think that he forced me to
be with him using his powers and pokemons and
something illegal that his association with the
team rocket busting operation made him familiar
with,he told me even then that if i thought so,hefervently apologies and even
then(tears,smile,kissing her ring),even then told
me if i thought he has got me back deceitfully,i
can still leave him immediately,he will be doing
whatever i tell him to apologize properly(tears,
kisses her ring again very tenderly).."
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,even if he has deceived you,you
won't get a better man in any lifves(hugs Misty) if
there's more than one..."
Daisy(patting Misty) : "you know we never really
thought Ketchum was the right one for
you,never...i had my doubts till i heard that speech
myself..no man or woman who doesn't longed for
his beau with all soul imaginable,can so intricately
yet so nonchalantly say the things he said...after
that me and Trace we just kept looking at each
other then both smiled and Trace said that he
never believed Ash and Misty could be separated
since he saw them(Misty blush,Lillie smile,smile)
he said that he had seen people fooling around
and fighting in between to be close and all that butthis fight was so sweet that he felt none actually
ever wanted it to stop at all and would rather like
to literally kill each other than to stop or be
friends;this fighting just was an expression of their
intense loging for each other all the time,simply
because their longing for each other was so deep
that they just at that age couldn't help but to fight-
it-out(all laugh) all the time to express that to each
other that without the other they just can't think
anything,this longing was so intense for their 17
year selves,it was just impossible to grasp and
manifest it...and i told him that i never believed in
Ash but not only has he proved me totally wrong
he has depicted to me,my own journey and
longing for my soulmate so vividly yet so
enjoyably that i would say i wish i was in those
rounds again and again just to enjoy it again and
again(all smiles)"
Misty(smile) : "yeah,and when i then just scoffed
at him when he was insinuating (all laugh) that i
may think he was deceived me,he again went ontoproving as to what was he doing, but this time very
naïvely and again was about to play his hellfire
rounds and this time it was more dangerous
cause he wanted to show me that indeed he has
cheated thus now he would again tear himself
apart and let me see his self destruction till i got
my answer,but this time i just gave a good
scolding(all laugh) and he calmed down(giggle)"
Daisy(smile) : "no Misty,he can get extremely
ferocious upon himself if he feels that he has to
show his soul to someone,get a lease on him(all
smile)
Lillie(laugh) : "Mist,I was thinking that your beau is
a sort of a person that if he caught you cheating
on him,rather than doing anything else would
totally destroy himself to see if he had any
problems himself to begin with (all smile)...really
get a lease on him and get this idea of having to
prove every step logically so that none can
insinuate(all laugh)anything,get this out of his
head"Misty(laugh) : "yeah,but at present even i wouldn't
be able to cause sweet sweet Brock hasn't even
seen him yet(all bursts to laughter) and he has
already declared his most intense longing for this
beau(all bursts into laughter) of his,i'll be there
with him when he thunder chairs Brock(all laugh)
cause otherwise for a person like Brock if doesn't
submit easily Ash will frequently appear anytime
in his bedroom on Gengar(all bursts into laughter)
and if we have our sweet sweet Viol Flower
there(all bursts into laughter) by good luck,it'll go
out of hand as his Gengar himself is in the eternal
hall of fame when it comes to tickling around(all
bursts into laughter)..but as i was saying what he
did after his encounter with the Cerulian sludge
that actually started his antics and trash talks...he
said he later kinda had an intuition that it might've
been about me,but again at first he just brushed it
off but then soon it made one permanent
impression upon him as he himself was going
through all hells then that no sludges no matterhow f.. idiots they were would run after a man who
not only could kill or snatch away all their
pokemons literally but given his antics and
popularity and mostly reach could even make their
lives a permanent hell,why would they run after
him as he never got remotely close to any woman
except Misty and no herd of buffoons would
chase after a man who was their girlfriends
crush..so he soon realized it was about Misty
indeed then also given the position of the
sludges,and this name in itself itself just turned
his head and forced him to tremendous hells as
he remembered his Misty was so devoted to him
deapite all popularity and he'd brush everyone
aside no matter what came to his ears about me
even after we broke up..and this yesterday he
elaborately explained is a swearing-in(all laugh)
that he never thought a Gym Leader like me
unless herself budged,no vultures could touch her
no matter what they would've achieved from
outside but her core would remain as pure asever...but then with his growing self
realizations,these sludges did what they did,now
he suddenly was all confused as of his Misty,what
if he was wrong after all?what if she did out of
desperation for himself did budge in the last days
for someone and that's why broke up?..you
know,he tortured me yesterday to get this fact
clear that he wouldn't even look at any girl unless
he had first broken up form his present
girlfriend,when in a relationship,it just has to be
honoured till break-up no matter how strainous it
has become,only after the break up would he even
look at any girl(tenderly cajoling her ring)...and so
now, all those Vultures with there what ifs came
around him and he was left totally bemused..but
this really started his self mortification...he
decided there was only one way to get rid of Misty
completely and that is to find someone else as
Misty might've done herself by now so that these
sludges out of some irritation came to date
him(all laugh)..then this made him most mercilessbecause now look at how he went about finding
his girlfriend (laugh,all wonder)..he would never
look at anyone in a way he would do to his
Misty,he just won't do anything that he did with
Misty but the exact opposite,and the only
difference was that Misty came to him herself so
to oppose that he had to go to girls and then scoff
and swear his head off to them for no
reason(laugh,Daisy&Lillie shakes their heads)...but
obviously he couldn't as that is absurd like going
upto a girl by telling her 'hellow!i'm Ash
Ketchum,Pokemon Master' and as soon as she
say "Hi!" he would(laugh) go like hugging them
and saying "yeah stupid b..."(all bursts into
laughter)..so it was a huge difficulty...so he
decided to do his antics and fuel his playboy
images and as soon as any girl was too interested
about him,they were sent right into(all laugh
uncontrollably).."
Lillie(laugh) : "the hell with his beloved Vultures"
Daisy(laugh) : "and their whole existence becamea living insinuation(all laugh) that they were stupid
b..."(all bursts into laughter)
Misty(laugh) : "exactly this,this is the exactly the
way he started with me yesterday,no matter what i
did he just kept throwing me away(laugh)..when i
sweard at him,cried at him,got angy,was
depressed,about to have heart attack,wanted to
hug him, confessed that he indeed was my only
man ever, rejected him,wanted to be friends with
him only or tried to forget him,longed for him,got
myself killed to show i do want him and never
wanted anyone else,got emotional,tried to kiss his
head off(all laugh)
,even told him he was my soulmate anything i
could imagine that i did,and no matter what i did,it
became an insinuation(all laugh) that i had
someone else in my mind but out of infatuation
was trying to reconcile with him or i'll be better off
without him or i was an absolute coward that i
was budging too easily or all i wanted was to be f..
around or even(all laugh) i was kind,generous,warm, anything you can
imagine all was an insinuation,when he admitted i
only could read his soul,only showing it means is
that he'll instantly want to bed me(all laughs),i just
couldn't show him at all that i was indeed his
Misty,to him-i was not his Misty's replacement at
all,no matter what,his Misty couldn't be replaced
and he was brutally showing it to his Misty
herself(all laugh)...and it was me who he ever
have had any feelings for,and finally till he could
show me that state where it'll be imbibed in me
what real soulmate is,and even after that to prove
words like chastity or ideas like bedding anyone
meant absolutely nothing to him(all laugh)...really
it wasn't till i was on his same level of
nonchalancy with anything that can be expressed
or imagined,i never became his Misty,his Misty
was he himself so i had to realize that my Ash is
also me myself.. only then the did the devil
confess(all laugh
)...and he intentionally preyed upon me yesterday(all laugh) cause my name was Misty(all bursts
into laughter) and he happened to know me
well(all bursts into laughter)...so you can
understand what would happen to anyone if he
didn't know well at all(all laugh)..and to him now i
realize knowing well was also defined by Misty(all
laugh),that is till he knew everything about a girl
for like 20 years(all bursts into laughter),he won't
consider her well known at all(all laugh)...and
that's why he decided,so when he saw that none
were any match for even on the most basic s..
hurdle(all bursts into laughter),what to speak of it
when he will tell them you're my soul only to
insinuate(all laugh)that it simly meant he wanted
to f.. around(all laugh) and whatnot..he would tear
apart every faith you ever had on
kindness,gallantry,everything would become so
garbage that he would basically tell you either
you're my girlmon(all bursts into laughter) or a
stupid b..(all laugh)...and whatnot,finally if you
passed all he'd start laughing at you that i'll f..around anybody except you all the time how about
that(all smile)...you had to show him that you've
grasped the fact that you were he himself..and
that's self realization so you can't show it to him at
all(laugh)..only if you went there and still came
back and fully comprehend his absolutely carefree
innermost self which he wanted yourself to
understand as you yourself (all laugh)...he later
told me,all he ever read or knew on philosophical
things like this he desparately read more to have a
grasp on what they may mean(all laugh),then went
on with whatever he realized coupled with his own
in-born beliefs to mercilessly mortify himself so
that his Misty would appear from himself only(all
laughs)...after we finally patched up yesterday he
said exactly this,'i'd sit in a corner and you'll go all
about it,i'll totally kill myself off and you'll totally
live all of it,but if you're indeed the one then as
soon as i kill myself completely,you'll
automatically appear exactly there(laugh,others
smile and clap)...literally he had so much beliefthat that's what soulmate would mean..."
Daisy(laugh) : "and he'll mercilessly describe this
process again and again to you just like my sweet
cunning man(all bursts into laughter)might still be
self-learning(all again bursts into laughter). till he
felt you can't insinuate anything else (all laugh) to
him at all,he won't stop no matter what,Mist,you've
caught the greatest legend (all bursts into
laughter)!"
Lillie(laugh) : "that no goddamn vulturemade
Cerulian pokedex(all laughes uncontrollably) can
ever insinuate about(all bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "and Dase,Lil,this basic name
calling hurdle is so extremely devilish that it itself
will totally destroy any girl(all laugh) and he
recharged me up yesterday so many times by
swearing-in encouragements (all
laugh)..yeah(laugh),he'd call you a b..,you'll almost
have a heart attack when he'll tell to to stand up
unless you're a b..(all bursts into
laughter)..and(laugh)..if you did manage to standup,he'd tell you that you stood up is the very proof
that indeed you're a b...(all laughes uncontrollably)
...plus he engaged his pokemons to look after me
and no wonder that's all because it was his
Misty,in his depth of soul he was indeed
desperately longing to get me back,anyone else
would've been volunteered to thunder-chair on the
very first point when they couldn't take it
anymore(all laugh)along literally with their
godforsaken pokebrats(all laughes
uncontrollably),had they too misbehaved by trying
to obey their master(all bursts into laughter), and
especially so as the Master's very own mad
tempered big brother(all laughes uncontrollably)
was sternly told that he'd not see his sweet little
bro(all uncontrollably laughs) ever again,sending
him to his most sinister mood(all laughs)
pikachuable(all uncontrollably laughs)...and you
remember that girl Serena-(laugh)the Master
doesn't make one scene till she doesn't get on the
ship cause he doesn't want her to miss it andthere itself create a scene after being
ceremoniously inducted into the hall of b..(all
laughes uncontrollably)..then smiles to his other
friends(all laugh) whose reactions he describes as
'the just crowned Kalos prince has just tasted and
just smelt the just perfect Kalos stool'(all laughes
uncontrollably)...then Ash said for the first time in
his life he was in the wasroom for 40 minutes(all
laugh) where he spat everywhere and puked his
head off(all laugh) then come out and still never
made any scene till it was his time to say
goodbye,when in his language he sweetly smiled
to his friends who thought "Kalos Prince has been
princely spat upon"(all uncontrollably laughs) but
then to their unimaginable disbelief (all laughs)
the Prince sweetly (all laugh) tells them just
that,that he has a girlfriend and he's going to tell
her what just happened,if they can save Serena(all
uncontrollably laughs) then sweetly greeted them
goodbye(all laugh)...this was his exact view of
anyone that ever tried to mingle with him toopersonally or physically...and then even more
brutally(laugh)..Ash described as he didn't
react,Serena thought that the Kalos Price is
thinking that 'Ah!what a cough,what a spit'(all
laughes uncontrollably)...so when he tried to
phone her first,she doesn't pick up(all bursts into
laughter)...only to make the Kalos Prince to follow
his big bro meticulously(all bursts into
laughter)...so he texts that he wants to declare his
longing for his beau(all bursts into laughter)..and
that he'll anyhow have to confess (all bursts into
laughter) on e day...so finally,that girl then was
phoned as soon as he got down and just as she
was in cloud 9(laugh),picks up the
phone(laugh),Ash sweetly says,'Serena it's Ash(all
bursts into laughter)',as if to gauge if it was
anyone else or not(all bursts into laughter)..and
then you can imagine that girl's joy(all laugh),she
just about stutters 'umm..'(laugh)..Ash goes,
'thanks for the urine'(all bursts into laughter)and
then told exactly these things with the fact that ashe was her dream since age of 4,she must be an
in-born b..(all laugh)meaning if there were
previous lives this was what she was,by soul she
was a b..(all laugh),and that meant she is solely
why there's a word called b..(all laughes
uncontrollably) and as if the girl could insinuate
(all laughes uncontrollably) any return with the
promise to be changed,enter Prince's beloved
girlfriend-the soulmate theroy(all laughs
uncontrollably)..now he set his girlfriend upon on
the sweet sweet girl(all laughes uncontrollably) to
meticulously but mercilessly (all bursts into
laughter) unvulturize (all bursts into laughter) the
fact,that she was the textbook eternal b..mate(all
laughes uncontrollably) to anyone she'll ever meet
across all lives,as now she has just been
immortalized as a b..(all shakes their heads and
laughs),permanent existence across whole
eternity(all laughs)...you can imagine what kind of
insurmountable hell the poor girl was thrown in
now that her soul itself has become a b..(alllaughs)...and this is exactly what the Master
did,just literally killed her off without any chance
of any resurrection...(all shakes their heads)...and
that's only the beginning (laugh),just after
cannonizing the poor girl(all laugh),his parents
were informed in exactly this language->"i thank
you wholeheartedly for allowing your daughter to
travel with us throughout Kalos,your daughter has
been very nice,a true s..,a great s.."(all laughes
uncontrollably,shaking their heads)..yes exactly
this which startled her parents to all hellfires
they'd ever come across buying the Master the
precious time (all laughs) to narate what she did
and finally and most brutally telling them that a
half grown s.. like that shouldn't be allowed to
roam around the world before cutting off(all shake
their heads and laugh)...this requires Professor
Oak and his mom's personal intervention to give
the poor girl and their family who were thrown into
literal eternal hell to have any chance of
resurrection which is scoffed off to hell again (alllaugh) in the presence of his own mom,when Ash
says he's been cheated on his trust and humiliated
in public by an eternal s..(all laugh),if they're telling
him to reconcile,his only message is that for a
playboy with his name and fame and reach and
power to be concretely blamed upon would
require an immediate biological proof(all shivers)
which the subjects can analyze to get the meaning
of(all shivers)...Dase,Lil,this is said in the presence
of his own mom with utmost nonchalancy and you
know he never saw his own father,no matter how
great a man his father was,which he himself is
very much aware of,you can understand what
unimaginable level of self belief and dignity a man
needs to do this...even pointing to his very own
mom two things,that whatever she told him about
his father he believes un absolutely and at the
same time if it's not true,she,his own mom to him
is exactly in that category for him...(all
shivers)...and you know he says his mom is his
soul...still at that moment for truth he was evenwilling to judge that as well..."
Daisy(shakes her head) : "this is all too much...
truely a legend across all hellfires unimaginable"
Lillie(solemn) : "and you see Dase,this you no
matter what, can erase off from the Master's
memory or can make him budge cause he himself
says that he has felt this eternal hell himself as he
was cheated on his trust so much that he even
insinuated an eternal hellfire to a woman like Mrs
Ketchum,his own mom...and the world may
crucify him for this,he won't budge as his defence
is true to himself and for all to see no matter what
others interpret it as...he won't spare himself
before being honest to himself...and that too no
matter what hellfire he insinuated his mom,she
would know deep down she'd also know what an
unique gem she has unearthed (all smile)..long
live Ash Ketchum(all laugh feintly)"
Daisy(laugh shaking head) : "and this legendary
meance(all laugh) would've brutally fallen upon
the whole humanity with his now power and reachand his 84 sinister soulmates(all laughes
uncontrollably)including his lunatic big brother(all
bursts into laughter) to induct(all laughes
uncontrollably) the whole world population to the
thunder-chair of swearing(all laughs)and if in the
process their pokebrats(all laughes) tried to
misbehave(all bursts into laughter),the chair
would become literal for them as the sweet insane
big bro(all laughes uncontrollably)was battle-
starved to unpikachuable desperation (all laughs
uncontrollably) for his next prey(all laugh)...unless
all persons meticulously started out to find their
respective soulmates,all the while logically
showing every step(all bursts into laughter) as
uninsinuable (all laughes uncontrollably) for sake
of their own well being(all laughes uncontrollably)
including their pokebrats (all bursts into laughter)
by means of the legend's own self
mortification(Misty bursts into laughter,Lillie
laughs shakes her head) to prove that no,not even
the greatest eternal vulture(all laugh) caninsinuate (all laugh)in any time across eternity,that
the legend or his beloved followers (all laughes
uncontrollably) wasn't honest with themselves(all
laugh)..had it not been for his only sweet eternal
weakness (all laugh,Misty blushes and laughs) to
get depressed to such hell that even the legend
had to budge finally(all laugh) giving the whole
population a desperate relief (all laughes
uncontrollably) to only focus on getting back his
eternal Misty Flower(all laugh) from any
unimaginable hell but through them all(all laughes
uncontrollably) to the eternity where he roams
around...Mist,you've become a legend too(all
laughs)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and Mist,the legend has laughed
and sweared off you depression too(all laugh and
clap)"
Misty(laughes) : "..and i got every bit of this
legendary swearing in yesterday (all laughes
uncontrollably) when i was his eternally beloved
only flower(all laughes)..i can see what anyrandom sludge from the world population had to
go through(all laughes uncontrollably)...long live
the depression (all uncontrollably laughs)"
Lillie(laugh) : "i can now understand why this
legendary brat(all bursts into laughter) can so
nonchalantly insult absolutely anyone..."
Daisy(laugh) : "and Brock's then girlfriend faced
the absolute full wrath of this uninsinuable
legend(all laughs uncontrollably) who eloquently
showed her(all laughes) Brock's anatomy(all
laughes uncontrollably) on their 2nd date(all
laughes uncontrollably) and instantly flew off to
any hell unimaginable(all bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and Brock realizing this anatomy
totally got straightend finally but didn't realize that
this was the exact upended form of the Master's
anatomy of his eternally cherished Misty
Flower(all bursts into laughter),and got so
incensed that he volunteered to commit the
biggest ever mistake in all eternity (all laugh)by
encouraging sludges to float upon ground(alllaugh) and that too had to be the from the Cerulian
drains(all bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laughes) : "and if a moment of emotion can
condemn you to eternal hell along with your whole
family,May God Save Brock eternally(all laughes
uncontrollably)"
Lillie(laugh) : "Mist,how did the girl and the family
made a return?"
Misty(laugh) : "through all hells(all laughes
uncontrollably)..when he went to Kalos they tried
to meet him,but obviously the Master had realized
that these godforsaken brats(all bursts into
laughter) may pester him again here(all laugh)...so
he resorted for the sake of his free roaming to
Charizard of all(all bursts into laughter) along with
his unshakable doctor of all kinds Bulbasaur(all
laugh) and his sinister big bro(all laughes
uncontrollably),and all while having the eternal
fool around champion Gengar(all bursts into
laughter),a demon straight from hell like
Noivern(all laughes) and the 2 utmost eternalbrats like Feraligator(all laughes) and
Crawdaunt(all laughes uncontrollably)..for air,land
and water travel(all uncontrollably laughs)...if this
wasn't good enough(all laughes) when he was in
public glare as they might've tried to pull any
stunts on him(all laughs)he threatened the whole
Elite4 to empty the whole area wherever he
went(all laugh) or else he'll intentionally lose all
rounds and later accuse them of not providing the
right safety measurements(all laughes) and if
even this wasn't enough then there was none
other than our beloved Muk(all uncontrollably
laughs)of all pokebrats (all bursts into laughter),
hiding all the time in dark corners behind Ash(all
laughes),which he intentionally chose to be at(all
laughes uncontrollably),lurking for any female
brat(all laughes uncontrollably) to breach a 3 foot
specified circle (all laughes uncontrollably) to hug
upon her mercilessly(all bursts into laughter)...and
if even this wasn't enough the Master used his
ultimate weapon by stating that he is gettingmarried just after this championship finishes(all
laugh) and thus wished if females behaved
properly with him he would be happy (all laughes
uncontrollably)...yes he said exactly this...as he
has been humiliated in public before by many who
hasn't been taught or was too ignorant in the
class(all bursts into laughter) to differentiate
between a brother and a beau (all laughes
uncontrollably)..yes this he said and has shown
me a copy of it cause he loved that antic so much
which totally put anyone way off him(all laughes
uncontrollably)...thus the poor family couldn't
catch him(all laugh)...then ultimately he went to
Orange, where his mind was a bit more disturbed
as our sweet sweet gentleman(all laughes
uncontrollably) had made life hell for him there all
those years ago and as this legendary nemesis
had the audacity to call him(all bursts into
laughter)as Gary,who only was authorized to
contact the master cause to him,Gary is the only
person in the world who knew how to be mostprofessional and least personal (all laughes
uncontrollably) perfectly that charmed the
Master's mood most(all laughes
uncontrollably),but as Brock to God would have it
the day(all bursts into laughter) he reached the
island where a godforsaken brat of a gym leader
(all laughes uncontrollably) to his only blame
caught too much attention of the Master's
blossoming flower(all laughes)in her teenage
dreams(all laughes uncontrollably) unfortunately
for her not to realize that after all her antics for
two years(all laughs) finally had inducted her to
the central attention of the Great Master(all
laughes uncontrollably) apart from his mad bro(all
laughs uncontrollably)...for the first time in 2 years
(all laughes uncontrollably) the Master suddenly
felt a little tickle(all bursts into laughter) in his
soul(all laughs) that his flower trying to flow (all
laughes uncontrollably) to the wrong side(all
bursts into laughter)...and if that memory at that
time wasn't good enough this same full grownbrat(all bursts into laughter) Danny now was the
one to harshly remind him of his flower(all
laughes uncontrollably),whom he instantly
realized to be indeed the Master's eternal beau(all
laughes uncontrollably) and thus only wanted to
ask the the Master if he has married her or
someone else as the master had announced in
Kalos(all bursts into laughter)...now as if all the
names and memories wasn't enough suddenly
comes marriage(all bursts into laughter) to make
the Master surpass his big bro(all laughes
uncontrollably) and just as the poor guy was
about to be thunder-chaired,our sinister
gentleman(all laughes uncontrollably) called
him(all laughes uncontrollably) after many years
as Gary wasn't there on an emergency and despite
reminding the gentleman that the great master
may call or have to be called and then just to tell
him to wait and give it to the main staffs,with
whom master consented to deal as they didn't
pester him after his stern insinuation (all laughs)via Professor Oak,this good gentleman(all
laughes) suddenly remembering his long lost
beau(all bursts into laughter) wickedly asks (all
laughes uncontrollably) him to tell him the island's
name(all bursts into laughter)...and that was it(all
Laughes uncontrollably)...the gentleman was told
that the master was already dealing with many
people who can't let go off certain personal issues
only to remind him of it without realizing whether
those were still fond to him or not(all laughes
uncontrollably)...yes he said that to slaughter
Danny completely...and now a man who suddenly
breachs his agreement with his reservation Lab
taking chances on his old contacts him,if these
continues,he'll have to surrender all his pokemons
and titles and badges and go back to being
someone who hasn't heard the word
Pokémon...this makes all parties to get absolutely
slaughtered and startle Danny to all hells as to
why this sweet sweet man,whom he couldn't
forget in 14/15 years due to his utter cluelesspersonal life(laugh) turning into an absolute
enigma once he had to battle where thouhh then
dormant yet an once ever flavour of unimaginable
intuitive power shown through or his eternal
flower(all laughs),who at that age just couldn't
express properly what she was had inside for the
master(laugh, others smile and pat Misty) thus
resorting to various antics(all bursts into
laughter),which all but the Master himself
understood(all laughes uncontrollably),this sweet
man was so gentle and behaved so warmly with
him even after being reminded of that how
famous a Gym Leader his flower had become(all
laughs),which he then politely scoffed of as saying
that yes,his flower was always excellent with
water pokemons(all laughs) which though then
didn't get Danny going then but he misunderstood
the Master totally in this regard (all laugh),now as
the Master salughtered him and his gentleman(all
laugh),he finally realized that the Greatest Master
will become the Greatest Legend(all laugh) if thename Misty Waterflower or her deeds was
personally attached to him beyond friendship(all
laughs)...so both Trace and Danny flew off to
whichever hell they first saw(all bursts into
laughter)...but during this all,to the greatest
disdain to Master, suddenly these 'stools from
Kalos'(all laughes) appeared as having the
misfortune to be relatives to Danny(all bursts into
laughter)...they appeared im front of the Master
but thank God they and their pokebrats (all laugh)
behaved as brother than beau(all bursts into
laughter) and now the Master couldn't say
anything to humiliate Danny,thus later agreed to
meet them personally,given the condition of 3 foot
circle(all bursts into laughter) and not trying to
make themselves or their pokebrats the cherished
food for his starving big bro(all laughes
uncontrollably) and if this whole Elite4 feared
infamous big bro wasn't enough(all laugh) as Ash
knew that no matter what,he or his bro doesn't
actually want to hurt anybody and that too topeople who weren't at all proficient beyond the
very common level when it came to Pokemons or
their handling and though Serena travelled with
him and could become a trainer which she is now
and in Unova,the whole Elite4 combined was a
child's play to the Master,so to his actual defense
he used the his most unholy aoulmate(all
laugh),his now right hand tickle master(all laughes
uncontrollably),invisibily present on the 2nd foot in
front of him(all laughes uncontrollably),which
simply means death from laughter(all laughes
uncontrollably) to even Suicune (all laugh)..and
Ash then sternly tells them before anything that no
matter what emotion may do,she should've
realized that he ever behaved to her as a big
brother and to him she was a little sister and she
broke his trust only to insult herself and her
family,to which the girl fervently apologized which
was scoffes off as you know(all laugh) insinuation
to get close to him again(all laugh)...this turned
her family on who were thrown into hellfire as theyaccused of being egotistical b.. as that's exactly
why they think he suits their daughter (laugh,all
shakes their heads)...Dase,Lil,this is living hell if
there's anything ever...which made all of them to
totally break down...but this statement bought
him(laugh,rest smile) the time to show his same
insane level of generosity which is exactly why the
girl and their family couldn't forget him or anyone
else ever can no matter what he did to them if
they've seen his heart...he basically babysit this
girl into maturity and made other friends in Kalos
to realize what life really is all about and taught
the girl about pokemons,so now she finally
realized what big brother she misunderstood as
she'll never have one like him in all hells(Misty
kisses her ring fondly,all smile)....(laugh,all
wonder)..so now Ash finally showed them his true
self telling the girl that she can keep im touch with
Professor Oak,which all of her family was and just
as she had started to do continue her journey
through Kalos and learn about herself the mostwhich'll be enough to interpret the world including
that of the Pokemons(all smile,Misty again kisses
her ring) and telling the family this time the rout
out of the eternal hell as well saying 'pardon is
bestowed only by own soul,not by anyone or
anything else'(all smile,Misty kisses her ring
tenderly) and simply walked off but(laugh) not
before the tickle master suddenly became visible
just infront of the girl(all bursts into laughter) like
so many times he did to scare her in Kalos(all
lauhh), to ultimately showing the Master's true
fool around nature and simultaneously telling
everyone that this hell was only to get the girl
straightened forever(all smiles,Misty kisses her
ring tenderly) and how lucky they're to even have
the sight of this once ever Legend(all smile,Misty
adores her ring)...and then later as Ash finally
decided to raid me(all laugh),he gave me all this
information briefly in his note to me,which
according to my sweet Viol flower couldn't ever be
romantic(all bursts into laughter) and tell her tophone me and Dase,Lil...the Master showes his
Mastery again and what level of faith he had on
himself and on his only weakness in this
world(smile,all smile),that even after all that and 4
years of no contact and his history with Serena
and Me and my depression and may be alleged
after break-up affairs and all that,he tells the girl if
she wants to meet a real Lady who could ever
match her idea of Ash(all smile) in all quarters,she
may call me after she gets to know from the Hall
of Fame for Water Pokemon Gym Leaders who
Misty Waterflower is and her contact s(all smile,all
pats Misty) with the note that he even broke-up
with me long before he stepped foot in Kalos and
only recently had to meet her formally(laughes,all
smile) due to his and her positions (all laugh,Misty
shows her ring and giggles)...and knowing full well
he was the centre of my full wrath then(shows her
ring,all laughs) and this poor girl could be again
resent hell(all laughes uncontrollably)...but such
was his faith that his conscience was clear withboth me and what he did to all in Kalos that
despite his playboy image which Serena was very
familiar with as the press said and all he knew he
truely is uninsinuable (all smile) no matter what
happened and his faith even then on me that
Misty may've found someone else but or even
have cheated on me just before break-up but i've
also seen her devotion to a no-one despite her
fame and skills and indeed it might be mine and
my image which i didn't clarify forced her into that
and still then she atleast broke-up rather than
showing me her new beau(all laughs)..and even
further he had the unflinching faith that no matter
what i'll still behave properly with her as he has
seen and known how i never even was rude but
only very firm with all those that pestered me..my
Ash remembered me for all the right reasons only
and always(kisses her ring,others smile and pats
her)..."
Lillie(laugh) : "Mist,this legendary pest(all laugh)
all along wanted you with unfathomable longingand devotion yet won't ever ask for a date or tell
his friends about it(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "as it'll be an insinuation(all bursts
into laughter)that she is all about bedding to
him(all bursts into laughter)..Mist,this eternal
legend would've literally killed himself immediately
yesterday had he not found his Misty in you(all
bursts into laughter)..cause that would've been the
last resort to see his real Misty...(all smile)..and
exactly here the self-destructive Legend once
more Masterfully shows what soulmate really
is(all smile,Misty kisses her ring fondly and
giggles)"
Misty(laugh) : "and then the girl probably had
followed suit(all bursts into laughter) after
knowing my details as when she called me,she
was trying her hand at that(all bursts into
laughter)...i told her why was she so upset,we've
had absolutely no contact for 4 years now except
a few days ago when he came here...(laugh)..and
see how the Master played both me and Serena,if itold her Ash is a cheat and he humiliated me,she
would've believed in it and cut off from him,which
saved him from her forever(all laugh) and at the
same time throwing me to further hells as i knew
he might've cheated on me but he still has shown
me what this exact girl did to him and what she is
doing now and this girl was with him after our
break-up and was there when the press was going
all about him..and also knowing that he humiliated
me and broke into my room but that sinister note
and all that and he did no physical harm to anyone
or anything and even my Goldy of all insisted
Pikachu can't do any harm to anyone ever(all
smile)..my Gym Leader Dewgong told me they just
didn't know what to do and nothing happened to
them at all,my Gyarados of all told me she was
only happy(all bursts into laughter)..and my Viol
flower(all laughes) told me,this isn't a
reconciliation note,he wants something else may
be something is bugging his conscience(all
smile)...and with all that i realized he infact inpublic humiliation, humiliated my depression
away(Misty kisses her ring fondly, others pat her
and smile)...and even if he did cheat,he still shown
me his heart by driving my mental demons
away,so with all that no matter what i would be
dishonest to myself if i berate him and even if the
girl cut off,her life itself will teach her how true
each of the Master's words were no matter how
much her trust from everything broke,the Reality is
reality and the Master again by self humiliation
and mortification would at the end of her life show
her that no he is uninsinuable (all smile) and also
to me that whatever Ash Ketchum may have
become,in my most desparate moment,he
repayed me my faith and devotion to him while
tearing himself apart from me by the veil of public
humiliation,(tears,kisses her ring)as if your Ash is
cruel to humiliate you in public but Misty,you'll see
i've only helped you(tears,fondles her ring)..."
Daisy(smile) : "really Mist, Soulmate by all
means.."Lillie(smile) : "so true.."
Misty : "and this just for one moment of
emotion,which i myself was so close to when i
parted him first time(blush,all smile),which he
himself later insinuated out of me(all laugh),and
Serena has spoken with me, she's as sweet a girl
as you could imagine..and this was her treatment
all cause he alwasy showed her he was her big
brother thought she finally realized,but when he
was brutally proved wrong,he became the monster
he showed me yesterday...and she called today
morning as just after his Orange Elite4, Serena's
dad and all personally came to patch up,for which
first they were told they were only after him cause
of his name and fame then finally they said no she
really means it,she has changed and whatnot,then
he finally said he had a girlfriend whom he had
broken up but still wanted to patch up but wasn't
sure,in the meantime this b.. did what she did..and
all this was because Professor Oak personally
was involved...so she got a chance with the factthat if he ever got back to his girlfriend,she can do
whatever she wished with her,that girl still didn't
budge so when finally she could get to me,who
was fed her name so that she got even more
insulted,was crying like anything to me making me
totally dumbfounded,and he told her that he
decided to break up but still a b.. like her needed
to apologize if she had any whatever left in her
and whatnot...and she was like so sorry you can't
imagine...just for one moment he mercilessly
beats down a truely good person and family...you
can understand what he became just before finally
getting me"
Daisy(patting Misty) : "just too too fond of his
Misty Flower(Misty blushes and hugs Daisy),too
sweet.."
Lillie(smile) : "he can't live without you as much as
you can't, Soulmate he truely showed"
...and he said that that he had me at his mercy,the
head-turning Cerulian water queen who wascherished by all Vultures of all breeds(tears) at his
mere mercy even when he was a no one and you
know people started to pester me as soon as i
learned to use Gyarados,for which the Master
always has praised me to all heavens and even to
his own mom once more today(kisses her ring
again gently,all smile patting Misty,tears)...so Ash
just mercilessly tore apart my body while doing
the same to himself by saying he was a unique
man even then that such a girl was devoted only
to him and as soon as the sludges insinuated
(smile) that,i rememberd then as Ash again
scoffed at me,that a then no-one like him needed
only a nod or smile to get the Water Queen all over
him(kisses her ring again,others pat Misty)..and
you know how true it was when he returned from
Battle Frontier itself,and compared my Ash,the
one and only man with whom i'd ever even
imagine in my wildest dreams to be physical but
also with whom i'd lose every bit of purity i can
ever imagine if he so wished(all tears,Misty kissesher ring with fondness)...where my man stood
with his behaviour fully knowing who his girlfriend
was and what she wanted,that Ash with what
these sludges were saying(tears,kissing her ring
again very fondly)...and then the sludges got what
they long deserved and i realized that it won't be
so easy to erase Ash off so easily and i went into
the death fight with myself,which eventually only
my Ash realized with along with his own
realizations and look,half a day and i like have
been his wife forever(all tears,Misty fondly kisses
her ring again)
just as he told him..and then told went in saying
get a hold on his nerves and don't get involved
with unnecessary skirmishes and your girlfriend is
very lucky to have you(all tears)..yeah(tears)..he
said that as you know i too came to infer..(all
tears)...and the sludge just got so dumbfounded
that Brock was scoffed to hell...and Lil,even after
giving me the ring he still told me,even after allthat,that i would've been in safe hands(bursts into
tears)...
he's from Kanto,that name
Lillie(smile) : "and Brock too i guess is his pet
now?"
Daisy(laugh) : "and Viol..(all laugh loudly)
Daisy(laugh) : "the way he told Viol to also keep
her pokemons fresh look after her family and all
that so amusingly as if our own elder brother was
saying but the language was so funny that you
just laughed yet firmly got his message,Viol
probably is his biggest fan now(all laugh)"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,you were talking about
chastity,Gary last night told me Ash ,once when 11
scoffed at some guy who was 16 or so on a party
or kinds thing when he was insinuating Ash(all
laugh) that he should talk with girls and so on,that
11 year old brat suddenly scoffed "what's the point
if the difference persists?" flustering all,whichfinally he showed all of us what he meant that
day,Gary ever daid that was the real Ash..Gary said
Ash was the most ordinary guy,and you'd know
Mist(all smile),and Gary even says this pokemon
master as well isn't a big thing etc..i only just
about realized what Gary can't say in words,the
Master Brat(all laugh) insinuated(all laugh) the
soulmate thing extremely well at 11..but then it
was just 1 year(Misty blushes,all smile)"
Misty(laugh) : "i can tell you now just due to
Ash,when i said yesterday you're a cheat,he went
on with that chastity thing mercilessly showing
me that it means nothing to him and at the same
time showing he didn't cheat on me till our break
up..i was so stuttered then he said why would you
budge even if your body was paralyzed, won't the
mind work,totally laughing off this most private
matter of women just as if it was absolutely
nothing to him..(laugh) then he showed dying in
battlefield and giving a friend a glass of water
which he can't reach due to his sitting position inthe table was exactly same as they were
luck,which again a word that his Vultures love(all
laugh)..he says the joy of pokemon was all he
knew and did that's it.... totally driven by
intuition...Ash Ketchum really needs me to survive
here(all smile)"
..........
[Gary enters 10 minutes later,and meets Lillie,Lillie
hugs him suddenly]
Gary(bit surprized hugs Lillie) : "um..Lil.. what's up?"
Lillie(laughing) : "Ketchum has caught me as well" (all three sisters bursts into laughter)
Gary(bit puzzled) : "um..i see,hey all..happy to see you..hey Misty..i have a big big surprize for you Lil and Daisy you too but what was it that.."
Lillie(laughing,hugging Gary) : "just send your surprizes to vultures now(all laugh),he has insinuated about our private life to everyone(all sisters again bursts into laughter)"
Gary(flustered,smile) : "um..what's he.."
Misty(giggling) : "Lil can i be him?"
Lilllie(laughes) : "be my guest,Dase start insinuating(all three again bursts out into
laughter)"
Gary(nervously, confused) : "what are you.."
Daisy(laughing) : "so Lil and Gary turned out to be the best fit for each other after all,ain't it Mist?"
Misty(laughing) : "sweet,sweet DaivyDevil(all sisters bursts into laughter).."
Gary(flustered) : "what are you three upto?..come on Lil,i have to.."
Lillie(forces Gary to sit down,sitting with him as well) : "just watch it and laugh yesterday out(all sisters laugh)"
Gary(bit shocked) : "um..that.."
Daisy(laughing) : "um..but really don't you think that their recent tension was just due to a
confusion among.."
Misty(laughing, immitating Ash) : "sweet sweet Dase(all 3 again laugh),why is it that i smell a few vultures cycling above us(all three again laughs,Gary smiles as well)?
Daisy(laugh,mocking confused state) : "um..fine they were perfect for each.."
Misty(immitating Ash's frown,all laugh) : "what was that Dase?do you imply that it's as if they Became perfect,became right,became together,became..(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "um..but when they first met.."
Misty(laughing,closed eyes, immitating Ash) : "Dase stop just there,i know what you're thinking Dase i know it,i can feel the vultures,Dase, they're trying,trying so hard to land on a spot(all laugh),they are so ecstatic about there success..Dase..i can feel their joy..i..i can see their eyes,Dase,Dase(all laugh)they are already feeling
their impending success,Dase,look how they are caressing the Champaigns..(all three bursts into laughter)"
Gary(laugh) : "what's Ash been upto off late now?"
Daisy(laughing,mocking a sigh) : "fine,they were always to become close.."
Misty(laughes, Mocking Ash's smile) : "so they were to ALWAYS to BECOME close?..Dase,this..just this(all laugh)..this is it..(Mocking Ash's frown and language) " the vultures have reached their spot..(Mocking smile)Dase,look at the celebrations..Dase..(all laughs again).."
Gary(laugh) : "come on you, I don't.."
Lillie(smile and stops Gary) : "just enjoy it,let the vultures do your works"(all 3 laughs)
Misty(laugh,mocks Ash's stern look) : "the vultures would insinuate that if they waited a bit more,a bit longer,a bit patiently,a bit meticulously..(all laugh again)..then it Could've been someone else,Could've been someone better, Could've been someone sweeter..(again all laugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "i get it.. Ashey changed from universally trashy to unequivocally sweetie.."(all bursts into laughter)
Daisy(laugh, immitating sigh) : "alright,fine,they were always destined to each other.."
Misty(laugh, immitating Ash's scowl and irritation and anger) : "Destined?Destined?Destined? Destined?(all laugh)..as if it they never knew,never saw,never felt,never understood,never..(all laugh again)"
Daisy(laugh,again Mocking sigh) : "ok,ok..they were forever like like this like soulmates,no matter what they'll always come together"
Misty(mocking Ash's closed eyes and smile,laugh) : "Precision, Precision"(all burst into laughter)
Daisy(mock dissapointment,laugh) : "Please let me go..they were like this forever..."
Misty(mocking Ash's anger) : "what did you say? forever?forever?forever only having the trouble to come to each other whereas that itself is no good as the Gym is forever packed during shows(all bursts into laughter)..no don't try to leave,Dase,else Gengleye will tickle you to death..(all bursts into laughter)..(again mocking Ash's anger) all those damn brats that ever had the audacity to challenge Gary's little sweet cherished flower to a
gym battle at 4:17 in the morning with an Onix(all bursts into laughter)..the damn vultures must very well know it,understand it,digest it,swallow it, assimilate it(all again bursts into laughter)..that it's not then, it'snot now,its not will be, it's not has been,had been,will be,not was,not is..(all again laughs)..but IT IS(all bursts into laughter)..it IS a fact that Gary
and Lillie are the same thing appearing to each other as a bit different,bit distant,bit amusing,bit charming..(all again laugh)..but they are always EVER the same reality only appearing as different here thus they are in essence ever the same constant ONE(all smile)and no forsaken Vulture or damn Cerulian Mob..(all bursts into laughter).. can
EVER do anything about it(all laugh)..."
Gary(laugh) : "that's how the night passed then...”(all bursts into laughter).."
Misty(smile,blush) : "um..well at this rate i could even tell the..um.."
Daisy(smirk) : "proposal"(Misty blushs,hugs Daisy)
Lillie(hugging Gary) : "go on, it's never been any better"
Gary(laugh,hugging Lillie) : "man..really Misty,you've bitten the pest long enough"(all bursts into laughter,Misty blushes)
Lillie(smile) : "anyhow Mist,go on with the proposal line.."
All in unison(laugh) : "yeah go on"
Misty(smile) : "alright,here,so,that one reality that in due to this mind and body seeming just like a mirage as Gary and Lillie to themselves as appearing in this world and though they realize that actually Gary is also Lillie and Lillie is also Gary yet as they have this difference appearing before themselves through this world their relationship is thus best interpreted in a way which is that,that which here is appearing as Gary and that which here is appearing as Lillie may please answer the question whether they do want to be (smile) Married.."
Gary&Lillie(hugging each other and holding hands,Unison) : "WE DO"
(Misty and Daisy claps and then all smiles and laughs)
Gary(laugh) : "and Tracey's having his proposal rehearsed now..(all again bursts into laughter)..meticulously (all again laughs out loud)..and i realize with hommade announcers my ceremony was a wastage of money(all burst into laughter)..but really Misty knows it but now the surprizes guess.."
Lillie(smile) : “the farm annexed?”
Misty(smile) : “way more gigantic..”
Daisy(smile) : “i see many arcs added?”
Gary(smile) : “6150 arcs,the full max,who Viridian Forest conserved area under Oak Labs(all wonder and clap and cheers)..and then again the 3 Cities cup renovated,Pewter getting many many things,Brawn’s laugh with be more hearty as well cause he gets his things as well and with all these Pallet Municipality will have to work hand in hand with us as well to get things done here and to be honest whole town will take a new shape but rather like a villege yet having all current and a few new facilities with Oak Labs virtually becoming the main centre..(all smile)..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,smile) : “really you know,Ketchum with his theory says and i realize as well we’re all a family for eternity infact all of us(all smile)..”
Daisy(smile) : “that’s for sure with my experiences last night but(laugh) we must word carefully still(all laugh)..”
Misty(smile) : “but that was only the least important of the surprizes..”
Gary(smile) : “second is Mr Hector Skechit was in an extremely serious legal toruble and his company was accused of encroaching Muk Inhibitant at Gelumsyellow and this falsehood was propagated by the rival groups fuelled by Platue vultures of certain HQ factions,then Ash was there saw a picture of Misty and that was the turning point as you must’ve heard and he was as usual incensed on the whole world that Misty wasn’t alright and he didn’t know her relationship status(laugh,all others smile) so chided the whole world from there that paved the way for the factions to take a grand beating and thus their works and all came to light and this was found out that Elite4 members themselves want to destroy may be a whole pokemon specis which is of course Kanto only and this is extreme serious offense as you know and a huge thing and many more a huge part of that nexus at Platue has been sweared into light infact and this gave him the leeway to swear off everyone from Pallet and get may be 100 deals done and yeah Giratina and Ultranercozma were indespensible there too(all laugh) and thus Dr Tracey Skechit’s name has come in front and Hector finally has come to know what he is and Ash too spoke in details about him,you know whole world knows Ash anyway and then Hector has got rid of his 22 year long illusion and his dad too and Trace has been finally too warmly accepted back and the rest is just happiness for all of us..(all amile)..”
Daisy(broad smile,shivering voice of joy,hugging Misty) : “really Mist,your beau is a patch-up master(all smile,Misty hugs Daisy smiling)..”
Lillie(smile) : “yeah,got the full family together finally..”
Gary(smile) : “with additions Lil,guess..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,broad smile) : “Viol and Brock will be here(all smile)..”
Daisy(smile,hugging Misty) : “this is truely heaven indeed(all smile)..”
Misty(hugging Daisy,smile) : “will get better with time Dase just the last and the best is left still..”
Gary(smile) : “Mr David Duncun,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame,6 leagues,6-1,grandpa might’ve told you about him,Ash’s undercover colleague main battler there was,i knew his name,but the biggest heaven is he is the brother version of May to Ash,just Brawn in nature and he comes with his other half,Zara and this sister-in-law of ours is out of profession and is a lawyer of big fame having worked many cases the two met during undercover itself then married after coming out she is too sweet like May as well and is the Drew version to Ash without those vomitting tests(laugh,all beams)..”
Lillie(hugging Gary,smile) : “during undercover and thus both have become family,we were saying he can’t live without family and thus it just by itself keeps revealing new gems and they keep this expanding(beams,tears in joy,all else beams,Misty and Daisy too tears in joy hugging each other,Gary broadly smiles)..”
Misty(hugging Daisy,smiles) : “my Ash wanted to become a Gengar so desperately cause nothing was left for him to do here was his idea and then you know his bunch and then that bro vs beau differentiation press,that was the pick of his instability and ghosts were all the time with him..Dave he met at Unova Round 1 itself in finals and Viol saw that match i recall and from there then undercover,Dave’s parents were killed in an accident cause by Team Rocket when he was 15 and thus the rest is understandable why he jumped in the fire and then my Ash went there and were great pals then like cousins,Zara too he knows as Gary said too well,and then Dave’s last region was Kanto,fought me for 32 minutes penaltimate badge,knew about me too well since undercover itself 4 years were like that too close and he lead Lance by 1-0 in extra sets so that too tells you who he is,he’s from Cellestic Twon,Sinnoh and Zara too from Sinnoh itself  and then again as i said during that famous press conference he realized my Ash won’t be sane and alive for long and confronted him then my sweet Ash you know ever too caring to them like what he was to May and was the same and Dave said,don’t become a Gengar so fast atleast me and Zara are reasons left for you this life atleast for you to not become a Gengar(all broadly smiles)..and that was the beginning then they are there at the farm just a set up and he wants to settle here at the colony now it’ll be and Zara only too happily reciprocated,Dave’s parents were in farming and uncle too and his cousin bro Lucian and his other half Tyala all very well to do and they are all just Brawn my sweet bee said and they know him and too happy with Dave’s decision if he decides and i know atleast if given a chance none would want to leave my Ash for sure(kisses her ring and broadly smiles and hugs Daisy,all others smiles broadly)..”
Gary(smile) : “and we all have seen him(smiles hugging Lillie all else smiles as well)..”
Daisy(broad smile,hugging Misty) : “yeah his lackie,great incognito(all smile and Gary laughs)..yeah David Duncun Professor said a few times,i recall now,only man to have ever lead Lance 1-0 in extra sets very marginally lost the second and then in third Lance got him and said was as good as Persy or he himself if not better..and yeah the undercover double hall of fame both he and Ash infact to be honest and i guess with Lance here and Trevor there all too known and fond of Ash and Dave too,that will be used to settle here as Kanto Hall of Fame trainer..yeah,Mist paradise by every means the bunch was here master now returns with extended family and such refreshing form(hugs Misty and beaming,Misty too hugging Daisy beaming,Lillie tears of joy hugging Gary beams and Gary also hugs her smiling)..”
Gary(smile) : “yeah,4 huge things really i was emergencied to the farm and then Dave greeted me fooled around a bit then the real identity and too nice person i got too interested a battle geek really and the Orange league he didn’t win at his 5th region was only a runners up there with opponent 15 seconds exactly late to pokecentre(laugh,all smile)..Zara too too sweet girl and they are married for 3.5 years now and yeah will be here told me none surely will leave Ash and family won’t for sure(all smile)..Lomstom will be reinvigorated as i said with 3 cities cup and he will manage and the Frucient Gym too Ash or he will provide people and cerulian goes 1 year shut down huge renovations there,all the plots as usual ushurped by that language cause they weren’t anywhere as he was travelling on Reshiram to places(laugh,all smile)..and these 6150 arcs with Brock’s provision if he so wished were made way before actually would’ve been done anyway even if he and Misty didn’t see each other at all and you all know about the quotes and thus you see,all he did was to give everything he could to us and go off with his bunch to be them and you know with that break-in and all he has reached an unimaginable state of attachment with his bunch in psychic subtleity and hence would’ve tried that too much and the result is known and all cause of the illusion of his own hindered his view of his Mist and hence his troubles now all fine and so you know Misty i congratulate you for yourself and also on behalf of whole family and me personally that i’ve got my twin back(all smile)..”
Misty(smile) : “yeah,Lil and Dave will be given our home here all renovated in renovated plans and mom you know herself will agree and will most certainly agree to come here at the lab and fulfil your wish for your mom as well(beams hugging Daisy,Daisy beams as well hugging Misty,Lillie tears of joy hugging Gary beams,Gary broadly smiles as well)..”
Gary(broad smile) : “well,bro for sure(all smiles and beams)..and Gradpa will be too happy as usual to have his daughter finally staying here(all smile)..(few moments later)..anyway,another huge news Misty knows this too Ash has faced a Lugia and Muked it(laugh,Misty smiles,others smile and wonder)..yeah,after the picture realization that Misty was his soulmate indeed still went to Kalos to confirm is knowledge from where he gained them at Venturiastrog of all places(laugh,all others smiles,Daisy laughs)..many lectures and books and so on 2 years thus his language and the discourse too(all laugh)..so went there a brat as usual was roaming around with max swelled up Lugia and Ash was contacted by Elite4 and whoose head persy is a fanatic fanboy and Persy we all know(all laugh) he talked with grandpa today itself and said,Ash wanted Muk(all laugh) cause Lugia was ‘namecalled illegally swellwed up namecalled half-grown namecalled Fearow’(all laugh) got him as you know that time and then went there,Muk saw Lugia said you don’t know how to behave with humans what’s the point of your glory vs me(all laugh) and went to Muk Ash and did as usual without resistence(all laugh)..this got the human brat perplexed and Fearow too then Ferow said you’re under bondage(all laugh) this is the trap that Ash and his brats are practising to get in and out for 19 years(all laugh),so Muk says,bondage is that which bounds you in this idea of battling for a reason that still doesn’t exist cause you can see i have no such intention and then you think so cause you want that hug of yourself(all laugh) that you can’t find cause you only hug what you like(all laugh) but they change this is better than that so you hug them but still all aren’t inclusive you’re tired cause what is now good isn’t later so if you don’t know this whoose in bondage(all laugh),this gets Fearow too confused(all laugh) then Muk says,i hug the changes of being to self when this idea of being tries to hug others i hug the being itself thus the being hugs me so i am me and thus i hug you only thinking you’re me,so you see whoose whoose beau(all burst into laughter)..actually it was the simulation of Muk vs Latios way back in Orange Finals and Muk again comes victorious(all laugh) so then the brat was caught and Lugia was at hospital later released and then of course this with Muk inhibitation here and then Hector all got Trace to have his full family again(all smile)..”
(10 minutes later Ash and Tracey enters,all bursts into even more laughter)
Daisy(laughing) : "three cheers for Ash Ketchum,Coupling Master"(all bursts into laughter
and cheers)
Ash(smile) : "um..thanks..that's funny..hey Gary,hey all..um.. sorry about last.."
Tracey(laugh) : "sweet sweet Ashy-boy..(all laughes even more)"
Ash(laugh) : "um..well universal sweet-boy to Orange-boy to stricken-boy to longing-boy to confession-boy to friend-boy to PLAYBOY KETCHUM(all laugh) to undercover-boy to demon-boy to villian-boy to philosophyboy to finally comedyboy now...(all laugh)..Gary,who's that Pokemon?"(all burst into laughter)
Lillie(hugging Gary) : "Ash,you've just given us that spark back again with Dave,Brock being here,6150 and Trace back to his family again and finally if Mrs Ketchum settles here with us(all smile)"
Ash(smile) : "um..thanks Lillie.."
Daisy(mocking Ash's anger) : "what did you say Lil?again?again?.."(all bursts into laughter)
Ash(blush) : "um..well it's a good thing that.."
Tracey(laughing) : "Vultures aren't insinuating anything.."(all laugh uncontrollably)
Ash(smile) : "well vultures did insinuate this one out(all laughs)"
Daisy(smile) : "surely Ash,i was never more angrier on anyone more when we first called in the night and never happier about the same person in a matter of minutes(all smile).i still can't imagine how someone insults just about anyone to death and torments his beloved girlfriend to hell only to vividly direct her to jubilantly accept his proposal and then goes to fetch the ring overnight in a city in which he's the most cherished villian and gets mobbed while somehow managing to get the ring by forcing the mob down to utter confusion and
on the way back to his fiancee rather takes a detour to nonchalantly come back to patch up with those whom he insulted to the absolute extreme just hours ago during their bedtime with such ultimate faith that nothing ever happened that he pulls a nasty prank on them in the end andthen jovially goes back to make his proposal official,which takes place moments before in the deep night under the glare of the most incensed people that are his family or like family who wants to crush him into pieces out of resentment over his prolonged cruelty and rudeness,pulls off a lecture with the words giving a completely
different impression to what he's trying to say,which is actually the most personal matter of
his relationship with his fiancee,all this taking place via a conference call where his fiancee is present with him as well,calms his beraters down to such a degree that they can't help but to become most warm,frank and beloved to him as they'll remember the night forever as every time it'll give them an ultimate strength and joy,and then all the surprizes and David as your bro just proves that you keep extending the family and they keep revealing themselves and Lugias too(all laugh) really,Ketchum(all laugh),the last 24 hours alone should get you to the very top of Hall of Fame (all smile)..”
Ash(blush) : "um..thanks Daisy..it was..um.."
Tracey(laughing) : "but hours later by this very same man who laughed his whole night off, i had the fortune to be graced with the most intricate epilogue(all laugh)so that no sinister words like BEST,PERFECT,FOREVER OR DESTINY(all burst into laughter) can ever get their dirty hands to his perfectly attuned logic on how to differntiate a compliment from an insinuation (all laughs loudly) as he scared me to death by triggering a false alarm among his pokemons that forced Mrs Ketchum and Mime out of the kitchen(all laugh)so that all could come here today for lunch(all burst into laughter) as he precisely inferred that his mom hadn't started preparing the lunch yet(all burst into laughter) all the while his fiancee
played along excuisitely well directed only through a momentary eye contact(all laugh,Misty blushs) and threatened to kill me by her Golduck(all laugh) that she was taking away from me(all burst into laughter) on Gengleye(all burst into laughter).Then this man beautifully proceeded along with our business(all laugh) all the while threatening me with his Greninja all the time as he proudly roasted all unimaginable breed of different types of specieses of various Vultures (all bursts into laughter) only to insinuate (all laugh) that he and all three of us the other guys should hold a ceremony right in the middle of the pool that's called the damn central battlefield (all laugh) in the gym,which never served his favourite dish for the guests(all laughs) and pick up our respective flowers(all laugh) right in front of all those Vultures (all laugh) and their Lackey the eternal Cerulian pests(all
burst into laughter) that ever thought what they're seeing is an illusion(all burst into
laughter)and then he concluded with the fact that if he's made the manager there,any dumbnut having the utter buffooness(all burst into laughter) to come as a challenger anytime except 11-11:15 (all bursts into laughter) in the morning without 7 league titles and 631 Kanto badges(all laughs more) will be given a most precisely prepared eloquent class on rigourous vultureology of insinuation"(all burst into laughter and laughs for a long time)
Gary(laugh) : "Ash you've truely become a Master of illogical non-implications(all laugh)which isn't imperfectly uninsinuable"(all burst into laughter)..”
Lillie(tears after laughing) : "no Ash,i've hardly ever cried like i did yesterday and i've hardly ever cried like now i'm(all laugh)...and the way to say extremely personal things in this manner so that any unimaginable hellfire(all bursts into laughter) melts away in unimaginable fun and joy in no time...really Mist,keep biting him all the time"(all bursts into laughter)
.....
...............

Daisy : "um..Mist,what is Trace doing there?"
Misty(bursts into laughter) : "Sweet Sweet
Dasisydevil(laughes uncontrollably).."
Daisy(frown) : "what's he upto now?"
(Misty bursts into even more laughter,Lillie enters
the room)
Lillie : "um..Mist..what..what is it?"
Misty(showing everyone the ring,which she hid
before to give the surprize) : "first this"
Daisy&Lillie(wonder,smile,laugh,hugs Misty) :
"aww!..how romantic!"
Misty(giggle) : "tell me about the time"
Daisy(thinking) : "um..(sigh)..i get it"
Lillie(flustered) : "um..yeah he wouldn't shopli..
(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)(smile)
hey,what..(realizes and laughs)..i see that little brat
had it with him all the time when he came in to do
the swearing out at the middle of the night(all
bursts into laughter)"
Misty(laughing) : "and was mobbed while
purchasing"Daisy(flustered) : "um..no Mist keep an eye on
him,in too much excitement he's being reckless"
Misty(smile,blush) : "um..as usual"
Daisy(smiles,Lillie smiles too) : "Mist,all these
years..then last night... it's just.."
Misty(laugh) : "Pokemon Master"
(Misty and Daisy bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smiling) : "i wish I was there,though Gary
would've never kept patience at that time of
night,and i was so distraught..bit today as Dase
told me..(smile)..he really has become a pest(all
bursts into laughter).."
Daisy(smile) : "it was just insanely amusing..i can
never forget this night"
Misty(laugh) : "and the time"
(both again bursts into laughter)
Lillie(smile,frown) : "hey,you must've woken me
up..(laugh)"
Misty(a bit concerned) : "Lil i'm sorry,ok? but he
was just..he was suffering as much as i was if not
more."Lillie(bit dissapointed) : "um, that's ok but.."
Daisy(patting Lillie,smile) : "Lil,all one needs to do
is to understand the number and the contents of
the hells that she must travel through/before she
finally can get to her beau(Misty&Daisy bursts into
laughter)"
Lillie(surprized) : "yeah,um..but what.."
Misty(smile): "Lil,all he was trying so hard to do
was to desperately make himself believe that he
has done enough to be kicked out once and for all
from every relationship imaginable so that now he
could just aimlessly roam around the world giving
everyone a piece of his mind with his pokemons
and fool around with his and all other pokemons
all the rest of his life as if himself a
pokemon,that's all"
Lillie(flustered) : "yeah,um..strange"
Daisy(smile) : "Lil just let him come here today,i'll
fix your meeting(Misty laughs), anyhow why did he
turn on poor Trace again(Misty bursts into
laughter)Mist,come on(laugh).."Lillie(bit concerned) : "still Mist, isn't it just too
strange..(Misty laughs and hugs Daisy,tears in
joy)"
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,the hells he talked about to
Brock and us Infront of his wife then he said how
body is all of blood and sweat,mind is emotions,
memories and futile attempts to recreate the past
as future when everything is getting past all
moment and finally the last line,that even a
recently turned public meance like him was
stuttering about(laugh hugs Misty,Misty laughs
uncontrollably)"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,get a hold on youself sweety"
Mist(laugh) : "it's...it's just..man..(laughes again) "
Daisy(smile) : "Lil,his last line was i don't choose
anyone that's not exactly me"
Lillie(smile) : "Ah!that..um..i get it now.."
Misty(smile) : "Lil,all my tears of 5 years or so and
all my strains ever all just got laughed away right
now,and i've been hearing this since he finally
confessed..this..this is...(bursts into laughte)"Daisy(smile,patting Misty) : "I guess sometimes
things like that need to(Misty bursts into laughter
again)(surprized,Lillie too) what(laughs)?"
Lillie(smile) : "Mist,you needed this laugh exactly
as your cure and even your first boyfriend
Ketchum couldn't give it(laugh)"
Misty(smile,Daisy Laughs) : "well he will argue on
this,but Dase(laugh)..um..sorry..fisrt as i did,he
just always says Daisydevil(bursts into
laughter,Lillie laughs and shakes her head,Daisy
too laughs)..."
Daisy(laugh) : "i see,that little pest has surpassed
all expectations(All laugh)"
Misty(laugh) : "what a night(laughes
uncontrollably)...."
Lillie(smile) : "baby,calm down"
Daisy(laugh) : "yeah,Mist,comeo on"
Misth(laughing) : "..um..sorrg..(laugh)..it's just that
almost any words is reminding me of his antics
since we patched up again..(blush,Daisy&Lillie
smirks)..um..anyway,he told me some novelsyesterday and the same which Trace is being
minutely and intricately introduced to
now(laugh,Daisy laughs)..out of which one was on
the fact that you and your beau are always ever a
couple like as if this life itself a play but you two
have always stayed as a couple like forever..as if a
destiny..(laugh)but if one said destiny,he'd mouth
them off to hell(laugh)..um,sorry..then from there
came his ultimate point"
Daisy&Lillie(unison,smile) : "go on pretty
interesting"
Misty(smile) : "see and its about the very personal
life of a couple and he has even laughed that
barrier off amongst all of us in a way that's just
unbelievable (laugh)..um..please bear with me..
(again laugh)..um..sorry, it's just impossible to
forget the antics..and it was only yesterday
afternoon when he was absolutely hellbent and on
creating every unimaginably cruel and
insurmountable barrier possible between anything
and himself..(smile) Dase,Lil,we're sisters,and yourhusbands all of us..we've just been so intricately
bound for so so many years,as one unit,then Ash
breaks away and we go through all this and then
no matter what,we always have had some
distance regarding personal life an then suddenly..
(laughs again)..um..please stay with me..his
words are still buzzing in my ears.. suddenly he
app...(laughs uncontrollably)..i just can't take..
(more laugh).."
Daisy(smile) : "you know Mist,that day with Mrs.
Ketchum,we kinda always felt a distance since but
she also was so cheerful today,we ourselves just
laughed it off"(then Daisy leaves the room for
some work)
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,um..i feel happy too but i wish i
could hear it LIVE"
Misty(laugh) : "all you need to do is to tell him we
were destined to each other in a way so that he
feels as though your not saying it directly but
insinuating..(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(bit flustered) : "um..i see but..(Misty laughsuncontrollably)(frown) Mist,cut it(smile)"
Misty(laugh) : "Lil,really i need help(hugging
Lillie)...the way you are speaking is exactly the
right one to insinuate something to him(laugh)"
Lillie(smile,hugging Misty) : "i see.."
Misty(smile) : "seriously Lil,i've been living a dream
since we patched up,and you know it doesn't even
feel a bit strange to suddenly call him my husband
at all,as if the fact i was ever anything but his wife
is very strange it feels"
Lillie(smile) : "yeah,we were taken aback when he
suddenly talked about marriage yesterday but i
thought he was just stressing upon the word but
now i see the little prick really meant it(Misty
laughs)"
Misty(smile) : "absolutely,and all this words
started to flow as soon as he confessed and
hasn't stopped since then..he just goes from
extremely serious mood to absolutely 5 year child
mood just one moment apart..but you know his
words are as honest as you can believe no matterwhat the mood is..and as i was saying you can't
say it was our destiny or we were right or best or
perfect at all,which possibly is what he is
rigourusly teaching Trace now(bursts into
laughter)"
Lillie(bit confused): "um..(smile) i see
soulmate..always together no matter what..and
then he probably extended it to saying all else was
like a bad dream not really existent"
Misty(smiles,hugs Lillie) : "exactly"
Lillie(smile,hugs Misty) : "and thats seeing
yourself in your spouse and the
hellfire(smile,Misty giggles)..and that's exactly
about yesterday-Laugh it out(both
Giggle)Mist,your beau has turned himself into the
Greatest Romance Master as well...(both
laughs,Misty bursts into laughter)Viol would've ate
him up in joy had she been present physically
here(Misty bursts into laughter again,Lillie laughs
as well)"
Misty(laughing) : "she almost did yesterday itself.."Lillie(smile) : "Viol too?"
Misty(smiles) : "oh yes!but she can't come before
a day after tomorrow but then(laugh)..he's hellbent
to runaway with me to unknown islands any
moment(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie(laughs) : "hmm..that dense little pest has
now got real dense.."(both bursts into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "mom said 'too much
imagination' "(again both bursts into laughter)
(Daisy enters,laughing)
Misty(laugh) : "what?Trace was scared to death?
(laughes,Lillie smiles)"
Daisy(laugh) : "they'll be here for lunch today(Lillie
and Misty giggles and hi-fives)at 3:30(bursts into
laughter,others wonder)..no,he's adoring Trace too
much now(laughs,Misty bursts into
laughter)..Trace said made him cry and then laugh
with equal ease and both were a lot..(Misth
laughs,Lillie wonders)..and knows everything that
happened in-between when he wasn't present
here(laugh,else wonder)..and yeah pretty much,(alllaugh)none can ever insinuate that(Misty laughes
aloud) that his flower was never ever not his no
matter what(bursts into laughter)"
Lillie&Misty(giggling,Unison,high-five) :
"SOULMATE!"
(all three bursts into laughter in a group hug)
Lillie(laugh) : "i just can't believe how can one have
such belief on himself to be right that he just
nonchalantly came to patch up as if nothing ever
happened and all was a play and that very thing
turns out to be true the very next morning..the very
next day all the difficulties that may be we ever
had of any kind among ourselves has been just
laughed away with no effort..Mist,this guy's real
dense(all bursts into laughter)keep an eye
always(all again bursts into laughter).."
Daisy(laughes) : "and sorry Mist,but even
yesterday all we thought was that he was indeed a
cheat,and then the next day we ourselves just
can't help but to laugh any resentment off..(all
laugh)..this is Patch-Up Master"(all again bursts out laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "and yet you don't know what he
did at Cerulian..(laugh)..oh god!..(all laughs)..after
he gave me the ring i came to know that he's had
first travelled to Cerulian,a city which is his enemy
no 1 and you know the viseversa (laughs again).."
Daisy&Lillie(smile) : "um..yeah but why would he
turn on Cerulian,Mist?"
Misty(laugh) : "because his flower had to appease
random guys coming around for gym badges at
any time of the day...(all laugh)..(smile)..no you
know what i just feel bad,he's trying so hard to
make up for the years that he wasn't with me and
his method is to either torture himself enough to
see how i was actually feeling,but his playfullness
won't allow that so he has turned his attention on
in-his-words Cerulian Brats(laughs) roaming
around the streets to insinuate(bursts into
laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "with that language and antics he'll
restart the Sensational Masters there(all burstsout laughing).."
Misty(laughing) : "and if i ever go back to perform
again he must be managing and won't allow
anyone except married woman with girl childs
aged below 8"(all bursts into further laughter)
Lillie(laughing) : "yeah Mist,he's just too desparate
to make the amends and already doing so with his
antics"(all laughes hard)
Misty(laughing) : "and i've been going through for
so many hours haven't slept a bit and look how
fresh i'm...it's just.."
Daisy&Lillie(Unison) : "Pokemon Master"(all burst
into laughter)
Misty(laughing) : "apart from the godforsaken
Cerulian brats(all laughs)..he's even more
incensed with Vultures..(bursts into laughter)"
Daisy(laugh) : "that's the reporters and pests"(all
laugh)
Lillie : "and they'll insinuate(Misty bursts into
laughter again) always that whatever he may
do,he's just trying to trick people and that he's aPlayboy"
Misty(laugh) : "exactly,i see the pain that he had
been feeling since our separation inside and just
had turned on anything that had a hint of personal
relationship,old friends,new friends just wanted
professionalism from everyone no matter what
and absolutely no personal relation...personal
relationship to him is defined as Misty and that's
all(blush,smile)"
Daisy(bit concerned) : "no Mist,as stubborn as you
if not more,would never still come back and say he
was sorry if he doesn't believe he's done any
mistake and would torture himself to death trying
to prove to himself that he was morally right and
that is all to him let the relationship go if they don't
understand me"
Lillie(concerned) : "exactly like you Mist,and as
you said and even now so desperate to heal any
kind of pain that he only now glaringly feels he's
put you through unknowingly,now desperately
wants to go through your pains again and again tojustify himself,really i mean you two truely as he
said.."
Misty(giggle) : "Soulmates"(Daisy&Lillie
laughs)...um,you know when he met me yesterday
and himself was describing what he did to you
and all else i could just see how much pain he's
constantly self inflicting,he real nature is ever the
sweet little Ash,but as we broke up and he felt that
that nature is exactly what his Misty didn't believe
him due to things happening around him and
left,so he'll just try desperately to prove to himself
and all else that,that nature isn't his own at all,and
it had gone to a obsession where he'd tear apart
anything just to see that whether despite all he did
he found his Misty again who really still realized
what he was trying to do and would run back to
him again and again no matter what kind of
demon he became.. that's exactly the hells he was
talking about.."
Lillie (concerned) : "My god! what a guy..would self
mortify himself to any unimaginable hell to findhis soulmate again.."
Daisy : "yeah,just opposite to Mist as she was
going everywhere only to thrash them apart
mercilessly as soon as her Ash showed up in
them again and finally was left with nothing
getting depressed till that very Ash showed up
again,and this you know Mist,when he was
piercing us through and through yesterday he said
exactly this as an insult,as soon as he lays his first
touch,you're running arter him without any
consideration whatsoever"
Misty(solemn) : "truely Dase,only he could
understand my problem and could do what he
did..um..i don't know Dase,may be i was still way
better than his own condition,what he's doing
around now is the actual playfullness that his soul
and what he's all about and you can see how
irresistibly enticing and attractive it is now that
he's just laughing off anything he ever did while
self mortifying in a way that it just floods everyone
away with him to playfullness,but what he hadbeen doing everywhere before,i just got every bit
of it yesterday,and you know all those hells he
talked about,not only he himself went through all
and wanted more and more so did he subject me
to go through with him till he himself confessed
that he can't beat me and can't shrug me off"
Lillie(concerned,hugging Mist) : "Mist,i was really
scared you know as well as feeling that abject
pain myself,i was really afraid that infact he
threatened us that even if Mist becomes insane
after this,he can't be leagally harmed and all
that,and we could sense what kind of monster he
really had become and was only going to come at
you with absolute all out to settle something that
was disturbing him for a long time but you know
as just 12 hours later he laughed all that off,i'm
realizing monster or master(Misty smiles) he's an
extremely honest guy even yesterday did only said
point by point why he was hurting us citing what
we might've ever done to him or to his mom and
all that...and none were wrong at all justexaggarated those to get his job done"
Daisy(concerned) : "indeed Mist,now you're telling
us we can see why actually his fooling around and
making all us laugh everything off as well,this guy
is obsessive in his conviction that whatever his
soul is directing him to do,is true and right all the
time and its just that thing now in the form of
laughter overflooding us as merrily as the hellfire
did burn us mercilessly yesterday"
Misty : "you know,yesterday i cried like i never
knew as he was dragging me through every hell he
could come up with and much more than he
depicted today and i seriously felt i won't be able
to take it anymore,and in fact he calmed me down
by the help of his Pokemons i don't know how
many times(Daisy&Lillie shivering hugs Misty)..
(smile)..it's ok,he would've gone with me as well
no matter where it took him to and you can see
that he had the faith and it was only me who
wanted to walk with him..he took me to
unimaginable depths of hell and all the while wascarefully observing me whether i budge or not,if
he felt i really did budge he would've instantly left
me and himself became insane as he would've
realized even his Misty won't walk with him
everywhere,he would've become exactly like what
a pokemon is his in human body,a total lunatic
who only wanted to fool around...and even after i
was coming back again and again thrashing all
the fake copies he was creating to throw me off..i
really thought whether we'll end ever or not given
our own stubbornness and just only then did i
realize that he has become an absolute lunatic in
his obsession to go hell after till he destroyed
every ounce of sanity he ever had and it just didn't
feel to me like we could be stopped or wanted to
be stopped because i too had become mad in
thrashing all his hells and run after him to finally
get together it just didn't feel i wanted to stop
either as he himself didn't want to,later only
realized what i felt then was what he was
describing as come for me again and againbeyond death..i realized his actual call and
obsession with himself to go beyond every death
and still continue to run never stopping and sanity
or insanity is a mere term there where he
went(tears,Daisy and Lillie too has tears in their
eyes) he wasn't Ash Ketchum at all anymore and
didn't care whether i was alive at all or he
himself,his being had crossed all limits and he
forgot himself forgot me forgot everything just
continuing his run as playfully as he is roaming
around now to where he didn't know, didn't want to
know but these too are only words to him,he had
become the very soul that we read and that cant
be described and was at a breakneck speed just
playfully with crackling laughter thay all his agony
had now become moving somewhere that none
can describe...this is poetic and we read only but
as you see your crying yourself (tears rolling down
everyone's cheeks) and then i found out that i too
am always travelling along with that playful march
of his soul forgetting any identity i ever knew-ididn't know whether i was alive or dead or
whatever i myself wasn't Misty Waterflower
anymore as he was no more Ash Ketchum,i too
had become the soul thay he had become and
was equally playfully going just side by side as if
playing hide and seek with each other and my pain
and tears had also become crackling laughter just
like his,i just then felt eternally always with him
constantly just the same thing appearing as two
different entities to us(all cries,Misty in shivering
voice)but now about to merge together but
actually we didn't want to megre we wanted to
keep that separation keep that distance between
each other just to play that hide and seek eternally
like mere kids knowing nothing else,he was me,i
was him,we had no difference at all and we were
only as if mischeviously keeping that distance
only to fool around together always together and
nothing there was possible to describe our
relationship or anything,we had become the one
and absolute only fooling ourselves with thisappearing difference that we were projexting to
enjoy ourself..in fact then i realized there was
never any Ash Ketchum or anything else at all it
was just me myself and Ash Ketchum was a thing
i myself had created to fool around with myself
and exactly to show me that was there ever any
Ash Ketchum at all and Ash Ketchum had just
shown me that...after this trace kinda state i came
back to my senses when i suddenly heard him
saying 'Misty, you must marry someone else and
have a good family forget a f.. like me whoose
hellbent of self destructing himself just because
he can' that word and idea of anything apart from
Ash Ketchum just pierced me so through and
through and then his self destruction which he
just had showed me to my own realization that
Ash Ketchum is nothing but Misty Waterflower,i
just couldn't take it anymore and screamed at him
that it's either him or bust for me he just laughed
at my face and that showed his own realization
that he went through just like me so many timesthat he just knew even now he could play around
with me all he want and said the words that you
won't be able to imagi..he said 'if i f
.. around any random s.. would i still be f.. you
around?' ..you can understand what he just threw
with what kind of audacity and vulgarity at me as
if this world with anything what so ever had no
value whatsoever at all and he was ever the
carefree soul knowing he was totally immune to
anything that this world can ever imagine to throw
at him and this was the whole point he wanted to
show me for all these 17 years i guess which he
finally could with complete mastery and utmost
audacity which will throw anybody off except his
soulmate all while fully knowing exactly that,and
now was just as if knew my answer and just
fooling around with me as he knew himself his
Misty was not what was appearing before him but
has ever been and being and will be his very own
self-he himself-so he now decides to swear
around left and right with unimaginablenonchalancy with me as if my appearance to him
meant absolutely nothing as he already knew and
had the true Misty Waterflower ever always with
him and will be...and these words along with my
realization made me understand that he was still
laughing at me with the the perfect knowledge
that his real Misty will eventually in just a matter
of moments pierce through the appearing Misty
and no matter what he did to the appearance and
Dase,when he said-i'll kill you and enjoy your slow
death and see if you want to die like that again
and again for me or rather get a moments chance
to be with me if the former assured an uncertain
but definite permanent union-he meant every word
of it as he himself had long surpassed any
limitations whatsoever so even if he was in this
world nothing really mattered to him at all...and at
this moment i just said yes he could never be not
but only ever be with me as he knows it himself
that i was only he himself(all crying)..this finally
appeased the devil and then with that samenonchalancy and playfullness he proceeded
formally to define by word what he exactly showed
me first hand that the nothing could describe our
bond in between most appropriately except saying
that we're soulmates and now this again would
make us laugh out even in this state(tears,but
smiling,Daisy and Lillie stopped crying and looking
at Misty now),he finished it with probably the
greatest audacity you can imagine while at that
juncture as if all was just as he showed a mere
appearence and self illusion with you admitted
soulmate and even that that's the word he laughed
off as he knew he had just shown what he meant
so his appearance and behaviour or words never
matter thus he said that(mild laugh,with
tears,Daisy and Lillie closely looking at Misty not
crying a bit flustered,with faint smiles)Ash and
Misty are soulmates and this fact no vulture,be it
of Cerulian or(all laugh with tears) any other
godforsaken breed(now all laughing with less
tears)can ever do anything about no matter whatthey insinuated(all laugh with tears of joy now)
and then finally admitted to reconcile with me,only
after the declaration that even in his biggest all-or-
none juncture,all his steps and actions has thus
been rigourously proved so that(all laugh)no
Cerulian Brats and Vultures (all laugh out loud) no
matter what they insinuated to (all laugh again)
could ever prove the fact that Ash Ketchum wasn't
honest with himself(all laughs with tears)
Lil,Dase,first to me and now to us all,just as
jovially he made us cry to death has he made us
laugh to immortality,Ash Ketchum masterfully has
shown that no matter what the Cerulian Vultures
has ever insinuated to in their damn books(all
laugh again),Ash Ketchum by totally self
destructing himself has rather directly shown
anyone what soulmate really means"(everybody
bursts into tears of joy and laughter and engage in
group hug,claps)

came to meet me and my group for everything in

brusts into laughter) that this present he bought
from someone to the master,is a special good luck
charm in such a way only in the presence of the
man's rosed little sis(all brusts into laughter) as
the professor proudly presented the thesis on how
to remove the unnecessary to find the necessary

removing the cook and the poor little bro of the

doctor him out of the cunning Bleziken(all brusts

was adoring this present from his sweet sweet

describe (all brusts into laughter)"

wink(all claps,laughs,Misty blushes and hugs Ash

Ash(laugh) : "yeah,thanks sister-help(all brusts
into laughter)..so what the little sis did to the
man?"

man was adoring this a bit too much too long(all
brusts into laughter) bit too sweetly, bit too fondly
(all brusts into laughter) bit too carefully bit too
minutely (all brusts into laughter),his sinister
sister(all brusts into laughter) conspiring withwhom(all laughs)?"
Brock(laugh) : " a certain wicked cook(all brusts

her professional skills and personal charm and
especially her particular movements(all laughs)
with and around big bro(all brusts into laughter)
who ever too happily too reciprocated to dance
around(all brusts into laughter) was apt enough in
sweet talks or not herself(all brusts into laughter)
when it really mattered (all brusts into laughter),so
what happened brother?
Ash(frown) : "the devillish sister(all brusts into

Ganger(all brusts into laughter) before her poor
oblivious brother(all brusts into laughter)to
insinuate(all brusts into laughter) the statement in
quote- 'observe closer'(all brusts into laughter)

left overs(all brusts into laughter),so the cook now
was evsdropping by appearing before the man(allbrusts into laughter) with a very grave long
face(all brusts into laughter) put his crooked

got confused and turned the picture over to see
the other side(Brock,May,Gary,Tracy,Daisy,Lillie
laughes),which had,um..(all brusts into laughter)"
Brock(laugh) : "sister,this also is better left to the
wiser flowers(all brusts into laughter)"
May(laugh) : "perfectly uninsinuable(all laughes
uncontrollably)"
Lillie(laugh) : "the seal of eternal longing (all
brusts into laughter), intuitively uninsinuable (all
laughes uncontrollably)"
Daisy(laugh) : "and excuisitely sweetened (all
brusts into laughter)"
May(laugh) : "thanks Daisy,thanks Lillie,but i think
we'll need professional help too(all brusts into
laughter) as to why the whole present was given in
a manner that's impersonaly imbalanced(allbrusts into laughter)?"
Gary(laugh) : "cause the professor personally
found(all laughes) something and impersonally
balanced it out(all brusts into laughter) providing
the precise accessory to the ultimate necessity(all
brusts into laughter) as he knew his student can't
battle it out(all brusts into laughter) cause his
sweet little big-bro(all laugh) would've
pikachupined(all brusts into laughter) to get rid of
this personal mess(all brusts into laughter) to
imbalancedly eat,battle,drink,repeat"(all laughes
uncontrollably)
Ash(frown) : "thanks for personally professional
help(all laughes uncontrollably),sweet sweet
crook(all brust into laughter),all of this doesn't
settle the the signature does it?(all laughs
uncontrollably)"
Brock(laughes) : "well the handkerchief was
better(all brusts into laughter)..why so little
sister?"
May(laugh) : "cause it hid the all the symbols fromsisterly eyes(all brusts into laughter) including the
Master(all brusts into laughter)"
Ash(sigh,all laugh) : "anyhow as the Man sees the
symbol and especially the signature,he has some
Gangers running through his whole body(all brusts
into laughter) due to reasons never impersonally
thesised(all laughes uncontrollably), but here the
temporally perfect cook(all brusts into laughter)
sweetens it(all brusts into laughter) with a
beautiful dish of suggestions (all laughes
uncontrollably) on how to preserve the signature
against the time (all laughes uncontrollably)...but
anyhow later as the sister realizes that the
girlfriend is only too apt at everything she has ever
done(all smiles,Misty blushes,Ash firmly hugs
her,smile)...except leading the bug speciality(all
brusts into laughter) unless it was the man's
unfortunate bunch(all brusts into laughter,Misty
hugs Ash firmly,smiles),who were told who their
real master is(all laugh),even way before being
cought(all brusts into laughter),just as everyoneelse(all laugh) and in this case the big-bro always
cruelly agreed to her than to his bro(all brusts into
laughter)..well the bugs helped the most on the
very second day itself(all laughs) as the bike got
replaced by he man himself(all laughs,claps,Misty
and Ash firmly hugs)...which if plausible may be
just a sample from the repeating repeations" (all
smile clap,cheer,laugh)..just as all else(all
smile,cheers)...um,sister have you ever.."
Drew(laugh) : "please allow for a rosey
distraction(all brusts into laughter),by now the
whole world has been sweared to know(all brusts
into laughter) the intricate details of the grandest
theory of devulturization(all laughs) of balanced
soulmates(all laughes uncontrollably).."
May(laugh) : "so as the poor sister was first shown
the process on her 1st anniversary (all laughs),she
got as usual,too flustered to understand the
motives of the Master(all laugh),and only after the
big cook's emotionally cooked call(all laughes) in
one past midnight (all brusts into laughter) today,it dawned upon her why suddenly the master
turned on her little sis when she said she couldn't
have had a day that she unfortunately described
as BETTER(all brusts into laughter).."
Drew(laugh) : "and the rose-merchant(all laughes)
thought how can the ever sweet bro suddenly
become the swear master pro(all laughs
uncontrollably) on a word that too on such a day
and as naive as better(all laughs)..but he also as
his rose-destination(May giggles, others snile) got
directed to(all laugh),realized if better wasn't
enough in itself it was already preceeded by the
most dangerous word that absolutely pierced the
rose of the soulmate theory(all laugh) by means of
temporal bondage(all brusts into laughter) and
that too which had a non-vulturized
uninsinuation(all laughes uncontrollably) that it
reminded the master a kind of relationship that he
himself wasn't pleased with unless was precisely
attached with soulmate theory(all
laughes),implying that how much the masterhimself wanted his own soulmate but as usual the
master would battle the comeback than date the
comeback(all brusts into laughter) as per the
order of his old-wise-bro(all brusts into
laughter),the word had to be all but anniversary
(all brusts into laughter)"
May(laugh) : "and then on hearing about the
eloquently sweard(all brusts into laughter) but
uninsinuably detailed(all brusts into laughter)
lecture on the soulmate theory,the sister and her
roser half(all brusts into laughter) too gleefully
realized that all the master did was to make sure
that even if we wanted to break up,may we go
through all insinuable hells(all laughes) to finally
unimplicate the soulmate theory (all brusts into
laughter)...and(laugh)..i can even say this and
sorry if i'm rude but i guess to all now it's only
funny(laugh),am i wrong eldest sister?"
Daisy (laugh) : "today itself 3 hours went on
supplimenting the occasion(all brusts into
laughter)"May(laugh) : "and the youger sister i heard has
been smitten by lecture since morning (all brusts
into laughter) though unfortunately she couldn't be
present on the class(all brusts into laughter)
Lillie(laugh) : "and she has been able to laugh off
any suggestions that her husband is with her
forever (all brusts into laughter),as the word
forever has a disturbing vulturization(all laugh)
that it says an effort to find the soulmate(all
brusts into laughter),as by now we all know the
perfect way to soul-searching->
quote,swear,mortify,repeat(all brusts into
laughter)"
May(laugh) : "thanks Lillie,and so now as in this
case,the brother was told today's the first
anniversary,which though did please the
brother,the chu-bro thought it can't mean a league
victory anniversary (all brusts into laughter) as in
chu-bro's pika-dictum(all brusts into laughter),one
should after coming back to home being 2 years
away,absolutely must catch the very first transportto the next league(all laughes uncontrollably) so
this created a tension between the
bros(laugh),and then if it wasn't enough even if the
master at first digested his biggest hindrence the
time(all laugh),now it was coupled with BETTER
(all brusts into laughter),so the lillte bro surpassed
the big bro by every way unimaginable (all brusts
into laughter) and in excerpt sweared that(all
laugh),the poor little sis with her poorer littler
rose(all laughes) must be namecalled to absolute
hell(all laughes) unless they were calledname(all
brusts into laughter) that quote 'didn't
(namecall)realize the (namecall)insignificane of
(namecall)time so that they may instantly
(namecall) break-up(laugh) as their own little
(namecall)existences itself made no
(namecall)sense(all laugh)' which now as the
world has had to be,mercilessly sweared-in to
redisinsinuate(all laughes uncontrollably) the fact
that Ash is Misty and Misty is Ash and as are the
rest,who weren't lucky like the master himself toswear the namecalled intuitive theory into
calledname reality(all brusts into laughter) allegdly
by Gangerizing through Kalos libraries (all laughes
uncontrollably) on darkest nights(all laughes
uncontrollably) or gracefully tenacious like the
water empress herself to withstand all
unimaginable hells to finally topple the grand-
master (all cheer for Misty,laugh clap etc)..but
those who weren't so fortunate like this once only
duo in all eternity as they always are being(all
laugh),can just sucide than to even think of
breaking up(all laugh) fearing that if the soulmate
theory is breached despite eloquent warnings(all
laugh),Master's full swearing would laugh off any
infinity limit ever describable(all brusts into
laughter) to force them into rather be as they are
cause this is the Master's message as we
interpret,any family skirmish or even relationship
skirmish if happens and one has completely given
up,just remember the master's masterfull
induction of anything to the eternal hall ofnamecalls(all brusts into laughter),to be more
than most happiest the very next moment(all
laugh,clap)..so basically the master has just
sweared off all divorce laws(all brusts into
laughters) and (smile)heartbreaks(all smile),but
most importantly,the Master has sweared off even
the little frown and scowl between soulmates out
of frustration upon each other and made them
always happy,always remembering the Soulmate
theory by heart(all smile,clap)..My big Bro has
masterfully shown another namecalled way(all
laugh) to family or relationship happiness in all
eternity...(all clap and smile)"
Ash(frown) : "i see,i'm the posterbro now(all brusts
into laughter)..by the way,why you travelled from
Pettlesburg to Cerulian-of all places (all brusts
into laughter)..."
May(bit flustered) : "um.. Cerulian should be
good..(all laughs even more)"
Misty(laughing) : "i'm eternally allowed(all
laughs),so i'm not excusing myself(all brusts intolaughter),Cerulian is the most unfortunate city in
the world as the Master's flower was the gym
leader there who is currently talking from
AWOL(all brusts into laughter),where the City's
eternal bugs(all laughs uncontrollably) dared to fly
through the entrances(all laughs) to not only at
first making the unforgivable mistake of even
buzzing the flower's name(all brusts into
laughter),then doubling the absolute sin by having
to look at her as she was talking to them(all brusts
into laughter) then finally committing the ultimate
sin of challenging her at 2 at night with an Onix(all
laughes uncontrollably),thus when the Master
steps foot in the gym with his flower,Mr Skechit
what are the unforgivable conditions?"
Tracy(laugh) : "well it starts as like a warning
template as 'hey namecall(all brusts into laughter),
don't ever look at her, don't ever utter her name,
don't ever talk to her,dont ever come anywhere
near the 1000 feet circle around her(all brusts into
laughter), don't ever call her, don't ever challengeher to a gym battle,and finally don't ever insinuate
that(all laugh) she did something great(Misty
laughs),as(laugh) any association of past tense
with her name would simply result in the a certain
another once only duo to mercilessly prey upon
you- Feraligator and Crawdaunt (all laughes
uncontrollably)"
May(laughter) : "no Drew hasn't seen Feraligator
that i had the greatest misfortune of ever meeting
(all brusts into laughter)that too twice(all brusts
into laughter),first time he replaced my pokemons
with exactly similar pokemons in same pokeballs
that weren't mine(all brusts into laughter) and
second time even more brutally he used my
Blastoise to water gun a Ponyta(all laughes
uncontrollably) as that unloved brat wasn't
swimming with our beloved brat(all brusts into
laughter) and if that wasn't enough for my poor
boy,he taught him that all Ponytas in the Lab can
only be tamed by defence(all laughes
uncontrollably),which he himself showed myBlastie but with a different one who was his friend
(all brusts into laughter),my poor Blastoise got
almost fried that day,only for the brat to wisely
console him that,yes what he said did mean it as
Blastie told me-that pest said he rather ever
feraligated that,attack is the best form of
defence(all uncontrollably laughs)..."
Drew : "but i saw to my exact affairs with hell(all
laughes) Crawdaunt of all(all brusts into
laughter),well he was a Corpish then but he
instantly ate up my roses(all brusts into
laughter),snatched away my pokeballs,tried to
spoil my bunch to do the exact opposite (all
brusts into laughter) and most brutally when the
little pest was caught for a whacking ,he made a
face that fooled everyone into letting him go,only
to their utter disgust later to see he has tore apart
all their dresses exactly which can't be described
in public(all laughes uncontrollably),and by
himself went inside a pokeball of mine(all laughes
uncontrollably)..and this was Corpish,i'd never liketo face Crawdaunt in any eternity(all brusts into
laughter) as now with his psychic abilities,he'll
probably try fool my bunch by stating that i'm the
one who was trying to steal them(all brusts into
laughter) let alone his sinister soulmate(all brusts
into laughter),who though doesn't have natural
psychic abilities which is more than made up by
his own abilities (all brusts into laughter) who as i
heard likes to fool everyone by taking them to
swimming only trying to make them his own
boat,on which he could water dance(all brusts into
laughter)with his size and strength (all brusts into
laughter),and i guess that's the reason why
Ponytas are so much in demand(all brusts into
laughter)..so surely this duo if together is
absolutely irreplaceable in all eternities...and
yes,all said how team rocket was beaten by these
two,no wonder,they that day just thought the team
rocket head was rather naïve(all laughes
uncontrollably)..Ash,from where do you keep
finding such only ever pests?(all brusts intolaughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "then there's hugging master
Muk,tickle king Ganger,boredom merchant
Snorlax,wisdom brat Noivern,showoff boy
Charizard,too caring Bayleaf,too sentimental
Torquail and finally too everhappy Heracross,who
has always pestered my poor Bulbasaur because
of his vine(all brusts into laughter),who is my
groups universally admitted leader but obviously
expect my sweet chu(all brusts into laughter) and
there are many more gems, Kingler being another
who is the most ardent follower of the two siniater
brats(all brusts into laughter),oh by the way
Heracross is a bug type(all brusts into
laughter)...and by further a way May why did you
go from Pettlesburg to Cerulian to steal and bike
back(all brusts into laughter) my sweet flower's
new bike to get it destroyed in the same way so
that playing sentimental insinuation tricks(all
brusts into laughter) you went with me to pester
my life out for the next 3 and half years to knoweverything about everything of the person,whoose
bike you stole in the first place(all brusts into
laughter)?"
May(laugh) : "without the his eternal queen
flower,nobody ever had any entry to go anywhere
near the master and that too especially for girls(all
brusts into laughter)..i reminded the master of his
flower's cycle,Dawn said Cerulian was a great city
with a very famous gym with a very beautiful
leader as she went there once with her cousin just
about 5 or 6 months before she met Ash,the
mentioned cousin now unfortunately falls into the
list who will be sweared off as he challenged and
deapite not being very good the Empress kindly
bestowed upon him the badge(all laugh),well as
usual that is that the Empress would do to even
Elite4 leaders(all claps,cheer for Misty,etc)..so by
now i don't know whether he's still among us or
not(all brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "Order!the Empress wants to
speak(all clap,order,laugh,etc)..Cilan was a big fanof Sensational Sisters and especially the Empress
herself(all brusts into laughter),i really doubt
whether he's still alive(all brusts into
laughter),Iris's first region was kanto and Cerulian
the very first gym(all laughs),so she might've been
born again by now(all laughes uncontrollably) and
now i've come to know that despite the master
had broken up,in Kalos too not to that severity but
still people were judged by the scale of the
Master's flower(all laugh)..and Sinnoh and Kanto
Elite4 were sweared into compliance as the
Master proceeded to date his flower(all brusts into
laughter)..but about the bug and the man and the
flower(all laughs),the man and the flower from the
very second day started to fake fight all the
time(all laugh) and though the man's big bro didn't
understand the point(all brusts into laughter) as
his little bro wasn't exactly willing to defeat the
flower or the viseversa (all brusts into laughter)
rather only prolonging it(all brusts into
laughter),which pikachued upon him(all brustsinto laughter) that it's called Pikachumate(all
brusts into laughter),thus since then the big bro
never even on the little bro's desperate insistence
ever fought his sweet 'lil bro's flower(all
laughs,claps,Misty and Ash hugs each other
firmly)."
May(laugh) : "but the big bro ate up the sisters
bunch many times despite the lil bro's desparate
warnings to go easy(all laughs) as to the big chu,a
pika doesn't get chu unless he's properly chewed
(all uncontrollably laughs)"
Ash(frown) : "i heartily swear everyone (all brusts
into laughter) who dared to hear my flower's
voice(all brusts into laughter) and had the
audacity to pain her vocal chords (all laughes
uncontrollably),anyhow this little sister opines that
the price of the signature-ink might be a good
topic to focus on(all brusts into laughter),which is
finally brushed aside by the man with the threat
that the roses will be sent back with greetings
next time(all brusts into laughter)...but still theman thanks God cause a certain foxly
gentleman(all brusts into laughter) wasn't present
there with the crooked-timer(all laugh) or the
pester-sister at that time(all brusts into laughter),
otherwise if the treatment and the prescription
weren't good enough(all laughs),the intricate
meaning of each line of the man's face during the
whole event(all brusts into laughter) would be
minutely summed up in a precise sketch(all brusts
into laughter) as the perfectly observed proof(all
brusts into laughter) of the sweet sweet hearts(all
laughes uncontrollably,clap,cheer,etc)"
May(laugh) : "well i'm only too unhappy that Mr.
Tracy Skechit wasn't there around the rosey
couple(all laugh)"
Tracy(laugh) : "why don't i bushdrop there May?(all
brusts into laughter),and why was it always a rose
Drew, variety is never verifiable(all brusts into
laughter)"
Drew(laugh) : "i'll have to sketch the answer out(all
brusts into laughter),as how roses are perfectlyobserved(all laugh) to be balancedly giftable(all
laughes uncontrollably)
Gary(laugh) : "well it perfectly imbalanced the ice
balance(all smile,clap)"
Drew(laugh) : "professionaly uninsinuable
Professor Oak(all brusts into laughter).. anyhow
we'd better get going now,..."
Gary (laugh) : "may the students be able to
unnesseciate the necessary if the necessity was
subtle enough(all laugh,clap,etc)"
May(laugh) : "bye all and yes from our
part,Professor Oak,balancedly agreed(all brusts
into laughter)...by the way from both Me and my
whole family to my bro,The Once Only Ash
Ketchum,Pokemon Master Hall of Fame of all of
His Own(all clap),we're very happy for your all and
our all,which i hope will be discussed now,a
surprize for the Once Only Misty Waterflower
Ketchum,who is just Ash Ketchum in a different
body(all clap) so we're not describing her much(all
laughes),bye to all(goodbye,etc)"....Misty(laughing) : "um,sorry but the empress again
needs to reharse her voice a bit(all laughes
uncontrollably),so anyhow what's the surprize?"
Tracy : "well it's a big surprize"
Misty(laugh) : "sweet sweet TracyDevil(all brusts
into laughter)...might i have an insinuation(all
brusts into laughter)..the farm is now enlarged
and annexed as a Laboratory Part?
Gary(smile) : "way bigger"
Misty(surprized) : "um..(laugh).. Crawdauntogator
has finally broken-up(all laughs uncontrollably)..."
Lillie(laughes) : "exactly the opposite(all laugh)
and only to be joined by Charizard(all brusts into
laughter) ,who's on emergency but trio-night itself
will force emergency(all brusts into laughter),if
they haven't already(all brusts into laughter)"
Daisy(laughes) : "and the hint is that the number is
only going to skyrocket"
Misty(looks at Ash,Ash smiles at Misty and hugs
her,smile) : "i see..(laugh,hugs Ash) Cerulian Gym
flying to Pallet(all brusts into laughter)?"Tracy(laugh) : "these words are nothing to the
Master's soul-travel..(all laughs)"
Misty(smile, hugging Ash) : "nah! I need to
recall(all laugh), what's up?"
Gary(smile) : "let me professionaly balance it(all
brusts into laughter,Ash hugs Misty and
smiles),according to future,Oak Labs directorship
has been professionaly and equally divided into
two parts formally as Professor Samuel Oak
completely retires from directing and being only
the mentor or advisor
for Dr. Tracy Skechit,whoose degree will be
conferred with special distinction next month and
will be sweetened as finally his parents has
agreed to come and stay with him(all clap) and
this thank goes to the master,who while putting
his sweet gentleman through all hells he thought
proper for many years,kept cajoling the
gentleman's parents as to what he is now and all
and finally managed his big brother to submit to
the Master's kindness as the master himself madehis life far easier with the Kanto Elite4,when they
thought the business was encroaching Pokemon
inhibitions which was a false accusations by
another opponent group who themselvs were
involved in a big nexus between the Kanto Elite4
itself,and Lance is totally a pet to our Master(all
laugh) as the Master insinuated things seemed
wrong to him..by the way the Master has made his
knowledge,reach and power through the very
same parties which though at first turned his head
a bit,but as usual the master came back with
flying colours as he started to get all informations
possible and later totally boss anybody around
with his own unique nature and thus the terrible
secrecy throughout Kalos,by the way he would
solemly discuss pokemons with especially any girl
that dared to cross 1000 feet(all laughs),and thus
bait them with his knowledge which were rather
gibberish (all brusts into laughter),as all he did
was to mix everything up in eloquent manner(all
laugh) to fetch their parents and thus getting thereach bigger,the oblivious sweet sweet turned out
to be most cunning fooling devil(all brusts into
laughter)..the Master thus has continued to play
his game of self mortification,which now from his
brothers and their soulmates are very sternly
warned against,as if he tries that again,he will be
thunder-chaired to muk himself(all brusts into
laughter),anyhow so now finally after almost 17
years of trouble,Dr. Tracy Skechit has finally been
able to come into terms with his only ever
personal relationship problem,his own family who
finally recognizes his achievements and warmly
turns the ice into the warmest sun,with also a
small insinuation to the Master(all laugh) that sun
is indeed beautiful on the famous Cerulian
Cape(all laughs) but even more so if it's quote
'Gymmed' well(all brusts into laughter),so here is a
big Thanks from all and by-the-way Trace,you
would like to say something.."
Tracy(laugh) : "yeah Dr. Tracy Wicked(all brusts
into laughter) says from behalf of hissoulmate,who knows only too well all about an
AWOL case(all laughes),and thus threatens the
Master(all laugh) to return his 2nd badge(all
laughes uncontrollably) which she gave away
without fighting(all laughs) with another threat
that may our coming future has the first
Pokemons chosen and be bestowed upon them
with all necessary wisdom about them by the
Master himself (all claps) and she so wishes that
may it be anything from the grass brand except
Chikorita(all brusts into laughter)...and here Gary
again.."
Gary: "yes,Gary Oak from behalf of his soulmate
Lillie legally claims(all laughs) that unless our
future is bestowed upon by the Master hismself
with all the necessary knowledge the first
Pokemon being a Pichu(all clap) the a certain
impending un AWOL ment ceremony (all brusts
into laughter) would be legally mouthed off to
postponement (all claps,laughs)...and again to
impersonally return to future(all laugh),as theDirectorship is shared by Dr Tracy Skechit and Dr.
Gary Oak,whoose degree would've taken a month
more due to official intricacies which has been
totally thunder-chaired off(all laugh) and his few
papers which wasn't reviewed properly despite
many proofs that they were unique findings also
hasn't only been gangered(all laugh) to review as
such authorities when faced with the particular
findings of Gary Oak on none other than our
beloved leader Bulbasaur with the our particular
Bulbasaur,was totally bemused by his once only
ability to properly doctor any pokemon or human
to the ultimate efficiency as he thoroughly
described before them about which these papers
were made by Gary Oak also citing such
potentialitiea and all that in other types from
various regions etc and thus when and thus he'll
get the degree with all distinctions and if his
papers are later cleared,there also must be official
apologies along with that and by all means the
provision of the deserved means to the lab,soTracy and Gary will get their degrees on the same
day same platform to also insinuate (all laugh)
that the achievements of the duo is unique and
thus needs precise recognition and what comes
with it,making them hold a sway just like the
master over anything that hinders their
research..and all kinds of accusations over papers
published from this lab has that has been made
over patent and all that which recently has given
the lab quite a few big troubles has been sent to
eternal hellfire citing the master's pokemons
themselves and for this the Master used his
beautiful Torquail(all laugh) whoose moods and
sensitivity to anything regarding pokemon
sentiments in all kinds(all laugh) has totally
bemused them that how can a once ever moody
brat(all brusts into laughter) like this stay ever so
happy with all in such a big lab and that too with
her own family(all brusts into laughter) and
absolutely nowhere else(all laugh),when she
sentimentally volcano-charged at them and thepoor Professor Kukui's Lab pokemons(all brusts
into laughter) and finally the Oak Lab will get the
distinction of Uniqueness in many fields which
wasn't conferred before as the directors didn't
quite agree with existing rules that has massively
hindered them with proper official apology that the
authorities now have to virtually make Oak Labs
the most powerful and unique lab by a far far
margin in pokemon world with many new sections
and all that and even the small branches in other
regions will be massively boosted now to make it
an once ever lab by all means the whole area of
Viridian Forest has been perfectly annexed to it so
that it'll serve as a catching ground but also as a
protected area so that no damn brat(all laughs)
can insinuate it to encroachment (all laughs) as
has been the recent trend,any sludge that tried to
make Pallet a township,has been totally sweared
off to all hells unimaginable(all brusts into
laughter),snatching away any area which was a
habitat of Pokemons,the whole forest surroundingPallet apart from Viridian has got the same
distinction,and the Master gives the full credit of
all these to his own only big-bro,who could only be
handled by Professor Oak alone except the
Master,his mom and a certain person gone
AWOL(all brusts into laughter),and whoose very
presence was enough to give everything
unimaginable to Oak Labs as they realized
anything else would compell the Master to forsake
his big-bro at their hand(all brusts into
laughter),the consequences of which is better left
unimagined(all brusts into laughter)..Trace,
personally imbalance(all brusts into laughter)"
Tracy(laugh) : "yes and along with the farm other
landmass whatever was existant and unused or
misused surrounding pallet all has been
gentlemanly foxed(all laughes) from any
vultures(all laugh) simply by stating they want to
make pallet and all a township simply because
they're using the Master's Name and any
pokegoon was bratted off saying that if notbudged they'll be gifted a pair of aquatic
present(all brusts into laughter),that'll make life
absolutely heaven for them(all brusts into
laughter),Virtually making Everything around
Pallet,the other little towns and all that has been a
rather legendary for starter trainers all will come
under Oak Labs now and their jurisdiction so that
as long as Pokemons are concerned,no
unpokemon business can imply anything about
it(all brusts into laughter),thus the little lab that
was started by Professor Samuel Oak and later
was enlarged to some amount now has become
an once ever one with by far the largest area,
distinction,power and uniqueness,the
headquarters itself has been made a colony and
many branches are also enlarged and
empowered,but again as the Master's own stroke
it has lessened the pressure from the directors
directors from even administative burden as a
huge group of extremely efficient staffs been
mouthed in(all laugh) via allElite4,Labs,Gyms,Pokemon
Centres,Contests,college students and whatnot
and all excellent- they're assembled from
everywhere.precisely assembled by none other
than our master's right hand disciple Lance(all
brusts into laughter) and his biggest fan Professor
Kukui(all laugh) and happily given to us(all clap
and laugh)...finally in one word,if it's properly
maintained and looked after,Oak lab is an once
ever miracle in the pokemon world(all claps)...the
Elite4 in Kanto will work hand in hand with it now
officially and abused and abandoned pokemons
thus gets more and more chances to find masters
and care and all that,and Lance was actually much
pressured before but now life has been made
extremely easy for him as he later on my personal
call to him today confirmed the Kanto Elite4
people who were hindering Lance and recently
had made his position almost untenable cause he
was the one barrier to their power abuse,but as
luck may have it on the formal dinner after themaster's Kanto Elite4 Victory which was his very
last match of the career before he was conferred
the hall of fame automatically,and the match itself
gave Lance much joy due to we-know-why(all
laugh)..but Lance said that,on the fateful day the
master was in his all happy tarsh-talking self but
due to his relations with Lance,the antics were
rather funny than confusing(all laughes)..then as
the Master wanted to know the history of the
Viridian and Pewter city gym,cause of Viridian's
legacy and Pewter's uniqueness..now Brock,
Forster's relationship with the master despite his
beau(all brusts into laughter)..
Brock(laugh) : "the Master confused my whole
family by always being as sweet as ever to them
but professionally(all laugh),despite his personal
things and he helped Foster much with many
things,so Foster never understood our problem at
all and to my then utter confusion neither did i,as
despite the fact what he did to me did,but i can
only say it was the only thing i didn't have and italso paved my way to my Viol flower(all clap) but
still i never understood the self mortifying nature
of the Master and all his games of ever sweet-ever
sour attitude with all who would curse you to hell
but send your very own relations to heaven with
equal nonchalancy,it was just impossible to
understand, through i now only have realized that
it's a double edged sword,those who were helped
would think twice as their very own would be
abused and alternative way the abused would be
utterly dumbfounded by the help that their very
own got from the same person.. that's exactly
from the all-conquering water duo's textbook isn't
it Ash(all laughes uncontrollably)?"
Ash(laugh) : "precisely (all laugh),that is who they
are in soul,just translated via many human
libraries,labs,professionals,bitter hangouts and
sensational parties(all brusts into laughter)"
Brock(laugh) : "long live the godforsaken,
godforbidden, goddamned water-duo(all brusts
into laughter),what are they upto now?Gary(alllaugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "they're rather submissive today
cause they've got their beloved opposite type
lackey there(all laugh),so they're today sharing
knowledge on different types of Pokemons to
enhance their skill(all brusts into laughter),and
Trace always told me that he is so happy that Ash
choose me to look after those two sinister
brats(all brusts into laughter) and always their
lackey if he was here and their disciple
Kingler(laugh) though Trace had
Torquail,Bayleaf,Snorlax,etc(laugh),but Bayleaf is
now out for a long tour at Kukui Lab so much
relieved(all laughes),but suddenly now Trace will
have the duo's only ever equal,who the Master is
kindly leaving for a checkup and rest, though rest
to him is a mere wordplay (all laugh),none other
than the once only Tickle Master(all laughes
uncontrollably),who has already broke Tracey's
orange dreams once and played a family wide
prank second(all brusts into laughter),now he'll bethere for a month(all laugh),and that too without
the one whom he actually rather loves to Obey
that's the master himself,so now the ghostly Pest
will uncontrollably run riot in the whole Trace
section(all brusts into laughter),which the 2 brats
here doesn't know yet(all laugh),and then when the
3 gets in there with none other than the Master's
beloved flower's perfectly balanced Golduck(all
laughes uncontrollably) for his rest,who after
some years of hardship, hasn't had much time to
actually totally be himself(all laugh)..so let go off
the power and all,Ganger is the highest evolution
od purest ghost type,Golduck beat psychic water
pokemon and Misty's Golduck may be the best
ever psychic type by all alongside
Crawdaunt,whoose the only match for Misty's
Golduck cause Golduck has way more heightened
psychic power but is rather innocent (all laugh),he
just wants to play around but Crawdaunt is the
nastiest brat ever to live(all brusts into
laughter),so now he gets a huge advantage havingGolduck, and then finally the least type strengthed
but the most brutal planning genius in all hells(all
laugh) and physically strong one and only
Feraligator (all laughes),who will now have the
Tickle Master as his beloved comrad if Crawdaunt
wasn't enough (all brusts into laughter),and you
know Ganger itself is an extremely dreaded name
throughout cause just what they can do with
anything and our special Tickle master is the
absolute legend once only among them(all laugh)
and his nature is very simple that- 'What is this
Ganger if full of care/We have no time to tickle
and fare'(all brusts into laughter)..so this guy is
absolutely perfect for Feraligator to get his tricks
done,and thus we have a Nasty Tormentor in
Chief,an ever Disturbing soldier,a totally carefree
fool around right hand with most pure and
supreme dark type ability and finally the most
brutal prank genius of any specis including
humans(all laughes uncontrollably)..then we have
the sentimental sister and chief disciple(alllaughs),and then you have the eternal bug
Heracross (all laughes uncontrollably),and finally if
Grandpa is out somewhere we'll have our Hi-Ho
beau muk(all laughes uncontrollably),who
generally doesn't go outside much cause he's
Grandpa's right hand man(all laugh) and a very
rare Pokemon,but he is another extreme pest to
mass pokemon peace,if he joins in with Ganger of
all(all brusts into laughter),then it'll be a meyhem
there cause Bulbasaur deapite his constant
meance Heracross can control all and infact
Heracross is rather pocessive of Bulbasaur,she
wont let others fondle with her illegal beau(all
brusts into laughter)..Bulbasaur can't control the
two meance,well none can except chu-bro(all
laughes uncontrollably),but he commands a love
from them,which gets the limits checked(all
laugh)..but Muk is absolutely disobedient to
anyone(all laugh)..and his first job if outside is to
agitate the Taurose group and let them lose(all
brusts into laughter),then he'd come to my part toobserve his two comrads in actions and have a
business meeting with them(all laughes
uncontrollably)..then he'd fake fight with Bayleaf
and Torquail's children(all laugh),then he'll disturb
Heracross's legal beau(all laugh),then would hug
Bulbasaur to death(all laugh) after that finally this
little brat would go to Snorlax of all and become
his boss which means if Snorlax's laziness and
constant disturbance with odd questions to
everyone like if you're a water type and i can
swim,why can't you climb that tree and fetch me
that fruit,no no attacks used i don't attack to
swim(all laughes uncontrollably),now Muk would
provide him the ideas like professional difference
between hugging and body slamming,etc(all
brusts into laughter)...chu-bro can control
absolutely all unless they bribe him out(all brusts
into laughter),but chu-bro's sworn in enemy is
Ash's Taurose strangely and he is a most common
Taurose but if chu-bro is around he suddenly
shows amusing intelligence by telling his group tomisbehave so that chu-bro gets angry and as he
does he'd then solemly complain to everyone that
chu-bro is jealous of Bulbasaur's leadership..(all
brusts into laughter)..which is a huge problem in
the group so chu-bro eventually has to chu-sown
and bro-up(all brusts into laughter),but this all is a
pattern,even Noivern and Gerninja they are rather
calm and nice but as i mentioned,the dreaded
Ghost hasn't been here for many days and has
never been out in the middle,he was with our
double-deaths before and knows them well but
they were undercover so he couldn't do much
there,and we've had a few ghost types but they are
very calm rather and many Psychic types they too
some are real meance but it's ok,but strangely for
such a big lab we've nowhere ever had a Ganger
and the first we get is an once only,so sweet
sweet times(all brusts into laughter),and he
already has made bossom friends with Muk and
licked Professor Oak to death the 2 days he has
ever been here,scared Lillie to death by suddenlyappearing in the bedroom(all brusts into
laughter),Constantly pesterd Daisy by every
means so that he gets his favourite dishes all the
time(all laugh),hid inside Gary's jacket and tickle
him all the time(all brusts into laughter) and finally
ruined some of my old sketches by simply trying
to reverse the shading order(all laughes
uncontrollably)..so if this guy meets the legendary
duo,snorlax and all,we'll have enough research for
all eternity (all brusts into laughter)..Bulbasaur's in
real danger Ash(all laughes uncontrollably),keep
him with yourself(all brusts into laughter) and
rather manage your ultimate overloard to take
over(all laugh),these meances to eternal peace(all
brusts into laughter) can only be tamed by the
once ever chu-bro(all laugh) if Taurose can be kept
at the farm ground(all laughs),chu-bro can make
sure whatever his lil bros buddies do,if they croos
a certain temperamental pikalimit(all brusts into
laughter), they'll be forced to infighting and get
chided at left and right for their unpikachussionalbehaviour(all laughes uncontrollably)during
battles(all laughes),but surprize surprize,if
Pikachu is shared enough food and
drink,infighting means who can fool around
most(all brusts into laughter)..and this still as
hasn't decribed the other gems among the rest/so
may god grant us some peace to rest(all laughes
uncontrollably,clap,all)..and Ash,if these four are
here all imaginable legends won't come anywhere
near to disturb our extension and empowerment
process human or pokemon(all brusts into
laughter) and that's why i guess Ganger's being
added.."
Ash(laugh) :"precisely,here he's protecting the
privacy of my flower's most cherished Lake(all
brusts into laughter)..that means at deep night the
dreaded ghost is creating hallucinations
everywhere along with his juniors Noivern to
protect skyside and Gerninja to protect
waterside(all brusts into laughter)..Gerninja has
Gyarados of all as sidekick(all brusts intolaughter),who'se lying inside the lake totally hidden
and enjoying the Kalos region's wisdom from her
new big sister(all brusts into laughter),and Noivern
has Talonflame with him,the two are rather
solemly discussing the meaning of pokemon
life(all laughes uncontrollably) under the dark
sky(all brusts into laughter)..Ganger told me he
alone is enough for land department but if i really
want i may give him his choice,which would've
been Muk(all brusts into laughter) but as you
know he's buy(laugh,all laugh) so i told him to
choose from our Queen's bunch,which he
solemnly recalled whoever he knew and he didn't
personally know anyone except Golduck,but he's
not there today so he said today morning a certain
gentleman he hostaged(all brusts into
laughter),who had a sweet little girl named
Marill(all brusts into laughter),who seems too
careful about life(all brusts into laughter),so if
such a version is available as Queen told him she
has only water types,which in his language isthose who resides in lake like his student
Gerninja,showing Gyarados,but Gyarados was
instantly rejected as being too emotional for
life(all brusts into laughter) which was tested by
illusion of many Gyarados' around her all trying to
kill her and just as she got enraged and used the
first first flamethrow into the water,the ghostly
menace suddenly appeared from all illusions
which if hadn't surprized her to death and
insinuated(all brusts into laughter)he suspects
she is a fire type actually (all brusts into
laughter)and his experience is that fire types are
very emotional especially in night time about
which no authority knows more than him(all
brusts into laughter) as he has met my Torquail
before(all brusts into laughter)and pestered her to
death the whole night and saw all of her
moods,which his student Noivern observed and
wisely commented that the girl is rather sad with
her pokelife(all brusts into laughter) which in
Gang-language(all laughs) too emotional to enjoydark-nights(all brusts into laughter),so Gyarados
was rejected,this made poor Gyarados almost cry
,leading his disciple Gerninja to handle her
emotions(all laughs)..so Azumarill had to be
shown as luck would have it queen only has taken
those two,and he's very happy to have a poor
sweet jovial girl like that(all brusts into
laughter),so that he'll scare her to death the whole
night as part of her practical on-hand training on
how to keep pests at bay,the forest lake version(all
brusts into laughter)..which the Queen tried to foil
but was licked to death(all brusts into laughter)
and rather had to agree or as his licking means
that it's a threat either he has his way or else my
flower and me wouldn't have any peace tonight (all
brusts into laughter)...get ready for the Gangerized
version of Crawdauntogatdelivered by Golduck
and reviewed by Muk(all brusts into laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "Ash,we've had many pests at the
Gym(all laughes),but would you allow to keep your
rocket-killers there(all brusts into laughter) so thatas a deal,we'll let you un-AWOL someone(all
laughes uncontrollably).."
Ash(laugh) : "i wish i could,but the badges has to
be sold(all laughs) or the Gym has to be changed
into the Hall of Fame water circus(all brusts into
laughter)... because as i'll have to have Ganger
with me(all brusts into laughter), suddenly you'll
see all gym pokemons trying to intrude the match
from all over the place(all brusts into
laughter),some pokemons would do the exact
opposite to what the leaders tell them to,the
challengers pokemons might've to be danced
upon in water(all laughed),gym pokemons will be
told about infinitely many strategies that'll get
them into serious trouble even again Onix(all
laughes uncontrollably),someone may suddenly
appear from under the water(all brusts into
laughter) and lick the challers pokemon or if not
allowed,tickle the challenger to death and finally
the challengers personal belongings,like gym
badges,some garments,like a sweet flower'ssweetly mistyevious picture(all laughs) with a
sweetest signature (all brusts into laughter) will be
totally destroyed(all brusts into laughter) and his
pokemons will be meticulously taught the art of
exchanging pokeballs(all laughes
uncontrollably),the lights of the gym may go out
anytime(all laughs) and strange sounds will be
heard and hallucinations will be seen only for the
lights to suddenly come on and just infornt of your
eyes someone will be standing to say thank you
for having a good night(all brusts into
laughter)..and if a Suicune tried to challenge in
open water,he'll be mouthed off first as being
complete idiot who don't understand that ocean is
the best place to play, ground is best for
battling(all laughes uncontrollably),to which if the
Suicune is genteman enough,would cunningly
sketch his way out(all brusts into laughter) saying
we'll do it in the ocean bed,but that is exactly
where death would grasp him as underwater with
either Feraligator or Crawdaunt means they gettheir full type advantage and huge playground,so
Suicune's tail will be bitten(all laughs) or he'll be
challenged in a dance competition and so on(all
laughes uncontrollably)..so you see actually none
of my brats are of any use in battling except
Mime,who's still sane(all brusts into laughter) and
among my lesser gems,they too will use every
trick they learn from the leader group and use
them,and even Bulbasaur will fool around with you
and he's very dangerous cause being the leader he
only knows eaxh singke tricks(all brusts into
laughter)..my Chu-bro only is ever ready to
battle,but he'll take may be a full day to battle the
challengers first,two for second and so on(all
brusts into laughter),cause he wants to see the art
of battling (all brusts into laughter)..so that's my
bunch"(all clap and all)
Daisy(laugh) : "But Ash,you know some should be
kept separated if you ever need,i guess Noivern's
for that purpose (laugh)"
Ash(laugh) : "absoluty not(all brusts into laughter),it's Gerninja actually,Nivy's system is that he'll
solemly give a well thought long lecture on his
thoughts(all brusts into laughter) after hearing
each of personal and professional problems of the
oppenents(all brusts into laughter) since their very
birth(all brusts into laughter),then once he finishes
and he faces one attack again he'll minutely
analyze all about it and if any problems arouse
there(all brusts into laughter)..now when this is
finished,the Challenger himself will be attacked as
by virtue of being their pokemons they have to tell
and interpret then Nivy will tell them about their
challenger's human to their Pokemon life
difference...which is that it'll take one eternity to
finish the first(all laughes uncontrollably)..after
that no legend would want to battle that wisdom
brat(all brusts into laughter).."
Gary(laugh) : "right,back to Lance,so Lance said he
knew the Master since Jhoto,and there he had one
we-know-who travel companion(all laugh),whoose
antics with her eternal traveling companioncatched the eye of all(all brusts into laughter),so
Lance certainly knew and given her own
stardom,he was a bit surprised that the Master
doesn't once mentioned the name Cerulian(all
laughes) or her name,he only said no his jhoto
traveling companions are very successful in their
own lives but he didn't know much them now as
he just has too much going around himself all the
time..Lance obviously didn't know about Brock
cause he has changed profession so it was
ok..now he saw the master wasn't interested in
Cerulian's history,so Lance just casually told him
that now Viridian is well as well as Pewter but
Cerulian's doing much better and then Master said
yes the the youngest sister there once saved him
from a jungle lake and then later met again in the
gym so yeah,but he hasn't seen her ever again(all
brusts into laughter) and it's nice to hear that
they're doing very well,then suddenly some
Vultures disturbed Ash,which made him angry
cause he was just having a lone talk with Lanceand all so he drove them off and then kinda
desperately told to finish the Cerulian part quickly
but then was told about the Hall of Fame of Gym
Leader's,and he was roaming around there where
pictures were there of the recent inductees and
all,then Lance said the Master's eyes fell on we-
know-who's picture (all laughs),which kinda tickled
the master(all brusts into laughter),so Lance said
when he returned after a few minutes he saw the
Master was in total oblivion as he was too fondly
adoring that certain picture(all brusts into
laughter),which made Lance to realize all about
the Master's antics in public(all brusts into
laughter),then Lance said as he broke the
oblivion,the Master jumped on him(all brusts into
laughter) wanting to know all the recent news
about the person in the picture and especially if
she was in a relationship or not(all laughes
uncontrollably,claps)..so while being told the
actual condition here,the master finally after 4
years of stubbornness decided to raid the all olddens(all brusts into laughter) with all might and
now the person of that picture has gone AWOL(all
laughes uncontrollably)...so after the knowledge
the Master gained about his beloved flower that
day he obviously surpassed his big-chu(all laugh)
by all means and chewed each of the officials for
each minute mistakes and not only that,Lance
said the whole Elite4 all over the world had to be
connected via video call many were still in
sleep(all laughs),and each that hindered my
problems or virtually any Elite4 problems
anywhere as far as the Master knew and guessed
and if that wasn't enough,none other than the
captivated team rocket boss,who is a according to
Lance a real fun loving guy now and he said he
can never forget 2 very common pokemons like
Feraligator and Crawdaunt (all laugh) felled his
whole dream,as he realized that legendaries are
just a mere wordplay (all laugh),all should just
have fun(all laugh and clap)..and he has since
then rather happily co-operated and had fun withall and now also gives some great advises to all
on how not to abuse pokemons(all laughes
uncontrollably) and how not to do thinga illegally
(all brusts into laughter),so he has been a massive
help,so even he had to be connected via secret
souces but that was later and Master just
mouthed any dark sides off and just asking the
rocket boss if he ever thought if a Master is totally
disconnected for his pokemons whether they'll
still be following their master or nor,this is that
he'll break in and then the whole outside would be
managed by his bunch as if they knew exactly
what to do without even being planned
properly,the rocket boss was summoned cause he
was the only person who has handled two
legendaries and including a Mewtwo for 3 long
years,to which the boss rather jovially said his
Mewtwo and Arceus could do that but they simply
were no match to the two that defeated him that
day(all claps),and that too with the Master
Himself,so the boss opined just to give his buncha chance,which satisfied the Master finally.Then
allnof Lance's difficulties were mouthed off to
total surrender and all that and the Master
dragged top post holders from all Elite4s to do hia
dirty works(all laughs) and finally broke into his
sweet sweet flower's room and the flower has
now gone AWOL sentimentally(all brusts into
laughter) as the master did all except to adore
her(all brusts into laughter) while she was under
his captive(all laughes uncontrollably)..so anyway,
by all means the Master has just like he did in
many many times in his career,basically in 48
hours has mortified the greatest hell to make the
greatest heaven imaginable right at the same
place and people by every means..(all
clap)...balance again(all laugh)"
Gary : "all the Master's pokemons barring Mr
Mime,Ganger and obviously we-knwo-chu(all
laughes uncontrollably) if stays in any of the
branches of Oak Labs can be used with full
freedom except battling cause they themselvswould ticklly refuse that(all brusts into laughter) in
all conditions,and also this Lab now has the full
support and certificate by the once ever pokemon
master himself,which actually means it can by it's
own might stand against all authorities including
whole Elite4 if despite proofs they are somehow
harassed...all the reasons except the research
why now Oak Lab is going to be what it is,is simply
the Pokemon Master's alleged weaknesses,ego,
infidelity, trash-talk and all(all laugh),as they've
made him such a threat to the whole pokemon
world(Ash and Misty smile at each
other,hugging),that unless he got his way,Team
Rocket 2 would've become a reality but may be
this time very much impossible to stop,as the
Master is allegedly able to make legendaries
absolute pets and do anything with them(Ash and
Misty again looks and each other,hugging and
they including all laughs)..if that wasn't enough
nobody understands how a man like has enacted
great respect from anyone who've been able toknow him personally and he despite doing all this
is the same man whose never been known to have
done anything illegal anywhere.."
Ash(laugh) : "um..just an imbalance Gary(all
laugh),i've abducted a certain Misty Waterflower
(all laugh) to date her all i want(all brusts into
laughter,Misty hugs Ash firmly,Ash smiles at her)
Gary(laugh) : "yeah that's dealt with later,anyhow
balance again(all laugh)when his public antics
becomes more confusing (all laughes) he still
hasn't breached any rules and all that know him
personally has praised him more and more,what
he and his pokemons do nobody understands (all
laughes) as they just play around and rather
forces the challenger to become friend and thus
the match itself actually becomes totally
meaningless (all laughes uncontrollably),this
alone has simply made him an enigma as though
he's in the pokemon world professionaly,it seems
he's here only to play around with absolutely
everything (all laughs) including pokemons,challengers and authority(all brusts into
laughter)...this man simply makes no sense as to
why he even exists(all uncontrollably laughs,Ash
and Misty hugs each other smiling)..this simply
makes him an totally lunatic (all laughs) yet
wholeheartedly sweet man(all brusts into
laughter),who seema plays around with his
pokemons like a little kid with absolute
inocense(all laughs,Ash and Misty looks at each
other and smiles)..but such a man if hindered can
become unimaginably cruel(all laugh) so it's better
that he's given anything he legally wants(all brusts
into laughter) to keep him as he is(all laughes
uncontrollably)..well Ash(laugh) Lance told
Grandpa exactly this even more jovially(all brusts
into laughter),and said he's the strongest Elite4
currently and he has very few matches in the
world but he was rather as his beloved and battle
hardened pokemons was enjoying the play and
though the referr had to declare his pokemons
defeated,he knows full well the battle,thechallenge,his position nothing meant anything
there with this unique enigma,he just went back to
his 12 year old self when he first started and that
itself has given him enough to continue the few
more years left of his service till he again returns
to being the 12 year old(all laugh and clap)and he
said he understood why a man like this can't be
honoured at all because of his uniqueness the
honours also will mean nothing but play(all
laughs) and so rather being alone he can play
around with the whole combined all pokemon
battlers hall of fame all he wants(all brusts into
laughter) and he said as he decided to rejoin the
pokemon master's hall of fame, it's rather our
honour to have him among them and he atleast
being one,would rather be in his in quote 'fool-
around' hall of fame than this one(all
laughs,claps),Lance said he called cause there
was a little tension yesterday at Cerulian City(all
brusts into laughter) involving him which was
reported to him that he just laughed off as heunderstands perfectly well the significace of the
location(all brusts into laughter),Lance joked and
this all,i've never seen him this happy and he said
he only called because he certainly understands
the recent antics of the Master and quote 'AWOL'
(all brusts into laughter) and with his dissent and
then consent to return to the hall of fame as
well(all laugh),so he was just very happy that the
Master is also the same as he assumed him to be
in personal life(all laugh),thus he called Grandpa
himself and told him he has had a very good laugh
all around (all clap) and also would love to meet
him again and if possible fake fight as well(all
laughes)..and that's not it,while Grandpa jokingly
asked about Cerulian Gym as Lance knows about
Lillie being here,Lance uninsinuted(all laughs) he
will also keep the Gym shut for the next three
months for sure unless the leader wants(all
laugh),cause he surely knows after many years of
gym battling,she absolutely deserves to enjoy
some quote 'team battling' (all laughesuncontrollably) all she wants(all laugh,claps,Ash
and Misty smiles at each other,hugging)...and
finally he said he'll surely be eager to see the
Master back at Cerulian(all brusts into laughter)...
but a cook also cooks for himself(all brusts into
laughter)"
Brock(laugh) : "yeah,Ash Ketchum,Hall of
fame,Fool-Around Soulmate Master(all brusts into
laughter) gives a special thanks to Brock Slate as
being the gym leader for his very first badge,which
on that day he didn't deserve to win at all as his 3
pokemons then wasn't any match for the Leaders
Onix and he only got it because the leader
believed he will get better and he also thanks the
leaders family as Kane Slate,Brock' father and
also former gym leader who also that day was like
his very own father and Foster Slate the current
gym leader,whom he has known since when
Foster was 5(laugh,Ash and Misty smiles)and to
him it's just a signature of love..then the Master
has basically made Pewter gym to hold sway overso many things that it'll take years for Foster to let
alone read and finish(all laugh) but then to
uninsinute it out(all brusts into laughter),so that's
that,and Pewter will also have a direct connection
with Oak labs as the Master rather sweared the
authority to hell(all laughes) as to why an unique
gym with rock speciality,which he himself has
come across only 2 times after that and that too
because he has won all 32 badges badges in
Kalos and 24 in Unova,he personally knows there's
no such Gym in the entire Orange,Hoenn and
Jhoto region,Sinnoh has only one,which he later
went to and found that it's only a gym cause it had
to mask the actual thing behind..so that
goes..thus while he has found there's only 1 such
in Kalos,1 in Unova and 1 in Kanto..only 3 such
Gyms are there and rock is a difficult type to
handle battle and maintain so while he saw Unova
and Kalos always bragging about their rock types
and giving them all they want, typically as he to his
utter distaste he found what happens in Kanto,thelower authority thinks because Kanto has
produced most Hall of Fames in Pokemon Master
Category,they'll get that up by neglecting certain
types of gyms like rock and fire so that the
beginners get it a bit easy...this disgusts him to
death because he had one of his dream matches
ever in a fire gym right on top of a volcano,and he
only after that knew fully what power fire
pokemons can hold and how difficult they can
become,so Kanto has 3 fire gyms,out of which 1 is
praised and the rest two neglected cause they
don't quite agree so easily,thus he hereby also in
quote 'sternly warns' the lower authority to follow
the Kanto Elite4 HQ order and report properly,else
he'll personally make sure that their positions are
under threat as rock gym becomes mandatory and
either the fire gyms will be equally sharing
pressure or else the mandatory fire badge will
have to be collected form someone that'll have full
authority to use his own fire types at their very
highest level,no trainer will agree to this cause asthey understand his absolute maximum doesn't
actually mean that and then he'll not stop to get all
fire types and send them all to that level
personally training them on the ocean(all
laugh)..well it means none other than Cerulian
ocean with the Hall of Fame Gym's best chosen
pokemons (all laugh), meaning the Master may
abuse Pokemons legally or simply send them to a
level that'll fool around the authority while having
like 30 fire pokemons in Cerulian of all (all laugh)
at the same time will itself be a too massive
trouble..what a Master stroke(all laugh)..which he
didn't say here(all laughs)..so it's better for the
concerned people that that's not done..so the
Master hereby sweared anything off(all claps and
laughs)..by the way Pewter got things that has
send it to such level,consider it a must visit place
anyway(all clap,smile)...then the Master has
announced to the world of his heart-wrenching
longing for his Pewter beau(all brusts into
laughter),in a way that'll propel him to uniquestardom(all clap),bur amusingly the Master has
made sure that his workload is lessened more
than what it is now,and that's why he has already
cancelled tomorrow (all laugh) as it was utter
vulture business (all laughes)..his beau(all laugh)
has also got a long list that'll take him ages to
read and figure out(all laugh) but it simply states
that he can do whatever he legally wants and no
stupid sludge(all laugh) can do anything about
it,this is a serious point Ash but i also know about
your final advice to Serena and family,thus this
and this sludge has been grateful to you and now
that you don't have any concerns the sludge also
actually hasn't let me go till he meets you again
for atmost once,and you can understand what he'll
tell you,as i said before..and you know way more
than me of the rest,so there's a question..."
Ash(Ash and Misty hugging each other,looks at
Misty,who nods,Ash smiles) : "only with me,only
once ever from both sides of absoluty any
kind,and the place is in the drainage itself,veryown drainage's outer chamber,i'll have absolutely
none and nothing with me except my clothes (all
laugh) and my Tickle Master(all laugh),granted"(all
claps and smiles and laugh)
Brock(lauhh) : "perfectly uninsinuable (all laugh)..
your Tickle Master is world dreaded for his Kalos
Final antics itselft and then Elite4 and all and also
he's the Highest form of Purest ghost type,even
the legends would think thrice(all laughs)
especially in dark nights(all laughes
uncontrollably),and i heard you'll go at night(all
laughes)?
Ash(smile) : "and may turn off the lights"(all laugh
and clap)..
Brock(laugh) : "perfect,well its also.."
Ash(smile) : "Brock, don't you cherish your beau(all
smile,clap)"
Brock(smile) : "meticulously (all smile,clap)..but,i.."
Ash(smile) : "Brock I should be the one saying
what you're insinuating (all laugh),but i don't cause
you're in the right art now(all clap) and also theother way around(all clap)..just leave it as an
illusion (all laugh, claps).."
Daisy(laugh) : "Ash,i have an insinuation (all
laugh),why is it so that i can see a certain
Ketchum encircling all the flowers(all brusts
laughter)...i know what you told or rather
encouraged to Trace on persistence of
observation(Tracy laughs) all the 4 years ago after
your breakup,i also came to know from my
younger lioness(all brusts into laughter) what you
told Gary just after your breakup,and i also know
the actual way of pushing Brock was left to none
other than his own father(all smile) as my Viol
flower told me(Tracy,Brock Laughs)..why were you
encircling the flowers(all brusts into laughter)?"
Ash(blush) : "well,that was a um..(all laugh)"
Gary(laugh) : "my sermon was the professionalism
in unnesseciating the necessary to find the subtle
necessity(all laugh),exactly what i tell everyone
now and i told our Pettlesburg Sister and Her rose
as well(all laugh)..and the rest of you know whati'm talking about (all laugh)"
Lillie(laugh) : "and well just like Dase,same for
me,it was a double edged sword that the Master
of Pallet Brats delivered (all laugh),the vulture
knew step by step what he was doing(all laugh).."
Brock(laugh) : "well,My dad was a gym leader then
and both my parents are extremely caring yet
extremely oblivious and single minded,which i
guess the sisters here understand what it is(all
sisters reciprocates and laughs),so my dad was
told to minutely find the right balance between
them and (laugh) in an unnamed letter where a
minute picture was drawn of a certain flower(all
laughs)..ya, exactly that,to show the perfect
balance demonstration(all brusts into
laughter),and was told to show his eldest
son,who'll figure out the rest..so my dad did what
he did,and i did what was necessary and
especially so after i got through the hellfires,the
letter was delivered much later though, it's as if
the sender was expecting things to happen..(alllaugh)..so who drew that Ketchum(all brusts into
laughter)"
Ash(smile) : "people from a secret well known
organisation (all laugh),who were actually Sinnoh
Elite4 undercovers,just too fond of me(all brusts
into laughter)..and Gary,well i just sort of it's called
what i told you that day(laugh),a Master retorts
only when the opposition is weak enough(all
brusts into laughter)..i just knew how things will
be as if you remember Daisy,Lillie none of you
were there that day and i spent an hour or more
afterwards looking at the now godforsaken central
battlefield (all brusts into laughter)..then Sarah of
all people came in as I was oblivious (all
laughs),she knew me well for obvious reasons (all
laughs),she told me many angry garbage (all
brusts into laughter) with the warning that the
visitors aren't allowed in this and that time etc(all
laughes),but i also saw how all of you were angry
with me i mean all the elder sisters,which was
ever the case anyway(all laughs),but helpers hadto comply cause the certain sweet main gym
leader of all herself had blossomed disturbingly
only at a very certain direction (all brusts into
laughs),and i knew only too well what my brothers
will tell me,by then i was patry-hardened(all brusts
into laughter) enough to be called in for a secret
undercover within a month after i won the
league..and my realizations were day by day
coming and increasing,so i just thought looking at
that battlefield and then the anger then recalling
all,i realized that if i'm not returning here a tension
will simmer cause i was the central reason for the
bond and i then was buffoon enough not to realize
that all it needed was exactly my presence for a
much longer time but you know i'm just like my
flower-extremely stubborn(all laugh)..so then after
Sarah chided me i mouthed her off saying many
things that are mere wordplay now,but well that
language and logic only got stronger
undercover(all brusts into laughter) and the
knowledge came from Kalos Libraries andhangouts(all laughes)...well my Ganger has fooled
many many authority figures(all brusts into
laughter),and did all illegal things there so that i
get full knowledge,he's an once only expert in
invisiblity(all laughes)..so i just said things that
made Sarah realize that i was oblivious but i was
gently wicked(all brusts into laughter)..so she just
never mingled with anything again cause she
knew her job was on threat(all laughs) and i sold
her a double edged sword(all laughed),after all
these,as I went back to the visitors room and
picked up my big bro,he was rather startled that i
didn't once told him about Mist that day which
was never the case as well he really is my big bro
by every means (all clap),he insisted to go and
have fun with the other gym pokemons which he
has always done there but i sternly rebuked him,he
you know being he,just ran off to where gym
pokemons were kept and the guards were warned
by Sarah by them to not disturb me at all(all
laugh),so chu-bro went in but the very first thingwas none other than Dewgong,to whom chu-bro
by then seemed to be an intruder as always(all
laugh),but i don't know what came to chu-bro that
day,as any other day he'll mouth Dewgong off by
Using Golduck,Starmie,Starew,Politoed whoever
was present whom he knew well and especially
after Sinnoh,as during Sinnoh miracle Pikachu
realized who he really was and since then the
word fear just has gone off from his dictionary
and that day chu-bro didn't use others or did
anything,he straight showed Dewgong what he
really was by an irontell to the ground that was
just enough to make him sit on his tail,which was
stuck inside the ground create a to show that he
was not only type advantage but processed
unimaginable power with the same skill to just use
them rightly,it was a statement that i can instantly
kill you all no matter who or how many you are
you're no match for me but i'm very gentle i don't
do anything unless you try to be unnecessary
disturbing in a way that now i realize a Suicunewould've done the same, Dewgong of all just went
away,and well i still have a fear for Dewgong
cause he's the leader and he never liked Pikachu
and my big bro doesn't submit to anyone so it's a
difficult condition..anyhow big bro then went in
but didn't even play he just have a quick look there
and came back to me and said Pikachupi,which is
MISTY in his words,and then just stayed silent..i
thought he somehow someway realized that
something must've happened to Misty and thus he
wasn't allowed to talk with her and all,and yeah he
never saw me sad inside the gym that much
before too,so he just wanted to check if Misty's
Pokemons were right or not but Dewgong came in
and he threatend him away to just have a look and
came back and said Misty,means its her,not the
pokemons, yeah that's his intelligence(all
smile,clap)(laugh),well he's sleeping now out of
disgust(all laugh)... then i out of emotion told him
'buddy may be your right' he obviously didn't
realize what i told him but was verysubmissive,then i came back of course with many
emotions but i somehow remembered my big-
bro's actions and it kinda dawned upon me that
even if the leader goes the pokemons stay,so then
i realized that Tracy comes here,Gary comes
here,Brock knows the place very well etc and
they're not going to go anywhere,and from there I
probably became more determined to cut myself
off completely from the Cerulian Gym and all so i
became rather stern and wanted them to do the
right things that i thought were right so that they
later won't well insinuate (all laughs) anything,so i
told Trace everything needs persistence and
results even if doesn't come a man like Trace
doesn't need to reminded that its all for own
sake,which of course the man being cunning(all
laughes) quickly picked up but tried to resell
me(all brusts into laughter),which gave him a how
sweet is the fire Brock(all laugh) ?"
Brock(laugh) : "Beautiful Little Hell with a little fire
that's a bit too warm for comfort" (all brusts intolaughter)
Ash(laugh) : "so that was it for Trace(Tracy
laughs),then Gary i knew what he thought of the
whole thing and all,i told him just do what you're
doing and no matter what you look after yourself
by all means first and just from difficulties you
know who to research out things do same don't
just get dissapointed and Gary also instantly pick
that up but because he was professionally
balanced just exactly opposite to his partner(all
laugh),he clearly reaziled i wanted to go away
without disturbing anyone or anything and didn't
want any tension because of me and finally my
Beau(all laugh) as usual went through all
emotions and then on a fatefull day just as i had
decided to go for the Undercover,i was in Viridian
then,and suddenly i was called as usual and all
that,i kinds knew that my beau would think me to
be and all so i rather was happy to cut it exactly
there,and then I reached Sinnoh and just before
going undercover suddenly i found that the art ofMantyke was doing some rounds in the City(all
laughes)...so i told my under-cover bros to get
some informations about how to handle a
Mantine(all laughs)..and they obviously scanned
Violet completely and told me what i needed to
know that the only man who made her balanced
was still peeking or not,and as he was very much i
againt haunted the man via secret sources in
sinnoh,by the time the news came i was already
undercover and that was the only time big-bro
wasn't there,i left him with mom,cause if i wasn't
there and some Vultures came along then I knew
atleast nobody could go past Chu-bro and my
whole Oak lab bunch no matter who they are plus
he was my backup..all he was needed to be told
was what he told me that day,master goes
pokemons stay..and that was it..in the meantime i
saw my beau was a much changed man and then
just sent things through Mr Slate cause i knew
him,he could realize things and give right
support...and that really was it,Gary only hadcontacts but not even once he said anything
except the day he got engaged and he didn't even
name Lillie and i just congratulated him and that's
all..this was kalos but then i became a brat by my
own right(laugh) and just was fooling around and
never recalled anything regarding here for a long
time and then decided to go away and all but i
knew i'll be in hall of fame anyway and also the
rejection-acceptance was also planned so that i
get my way and all that but suddenly then my
flower came back in and actually i would've been
in Kalos cause i know the whole place in some
library buying it and making my own or be near
professor Kukui's lab...i wanted to date my little
flower but then thought may be i'll be disturbing
her,may be her problems aren't at all due to me
and so on..and i never even wanted to know
anything about here so i wasn't really sure despite
knowing all but then finally a brat decided to
challenge with his half grown fearow(all brusts
into laughter)..so i then knew even legends are nomatch for my bunch,so i was assured that this
pokemon world was finished completely for me
and the rest may be 50/60 year retirement,as soon
as the 50/60 came in i realized how much of an
utter bufoon i was and when i could've easily
came here pass a month and return,i went for
badges which by then was formality almost i just
liked the travelling...so i straightaway returned
here to finish my works and finally know
everything about here and then decide..but
fortunately my flower forgave me despite all that i
did to her and we're going AWOL both
now(laugh,all laugh,smile)..."
Daisy : "yeah,but don't ever try to prove step by
step everything that you do and don't forget that
you indeed are the centre of the bond"
Ash(blush) : "well,thanks for accepting me back.."
Brock(laugh) : "mere wordplay(all laugh),this was
as easy as that..and how should the grammar be
Trace?"
Tracy(laugh) : "no past tense"Gary(laugh) : "professionally agreed"
Lillie(laugh): "intuitively verified"
Misty(hugging Ash firmly,smile): "finally,Soully
Meted"(Ash and Misty hugs each other firmly
giggling at each other,rest clap etc.)
Brock: "right,anyhow,i can just about do
anything,so by virtue of that,if my flower
agrees,which her sisters know about(all sisters
laugh),i'll long to join Oak Lab itself,and if
permitted open a new pokmon centre(all claps)
somewhere where's necessary,so..."
Gary&Tracy(Union) : "professionally and equally
granted(all claps)
Brock : "now there's also i heard lists were
sent,wherever the Master ever felt he got any bit
of help,which i believe now will make the whole
Elite4 bite all unimaginable hands off(all brusts
into laughter) except Lance(all clap,laugh)..And
Ash,you heard May and Drew today,the rest all has
followed suit,all of your travel companions that i
know upto Unova and many others that Gary toldme,your Kalos friends too including Serena(all
laughes)who was only too mystified by your
Misty(all laughes uncontrollably) and has become
an absolute pet(all laughes),well all of those 3
poor souls have(all laughes),so they've happily
obliges too as Gary told me before...also except
that many other things has many other lists that's
probably now reaches to all hells unimaginable(all
laugh) and penultimate thing is that what our
sweet brat rockets(all laugh) and their pal(all
laughes) got,they got a gift, Master's only gift by
monetary means as it has to be sent through
secret Elite4 channels,which by the way,i mean
you know when we think yeah like Elite4, anything
in the pokemon world as long as humans are
concerned has been just made meaningless by
the master except ONE with whom he is ONE(all
laugh)..anyhow the ONE comes obviously at the
end to allegedly have a sway on anything she
wants(all laughes),which includes the Master
himself(all laugh,clap,Ash smiles at Misty whogiggles back)..anyhow the rockets are now
married couple, surprized, surprize(all laughes)
got the gift for helping him once in Kalos in a
tough situation in a court case which they thought
they only repaying as they were saved first,but the
master only ever remembered what he got himself
and thus a small gift for which they of all has
cruelly thanked themselves(all laugh),that they
finally have beaten the enemy (all laugh) by
befriending him(all claps and laughes)..but the
rocket duo have insinuated(all brusts into
laughter) that they're absolute enjoying the grown
up version of their so familiar bug around play(all
brusts into laughter) played then by the master
and a quote 'bug specialist twerpetee'(all brusts
into laughter),and they also encouraged the
master to never to stop it(all brusts into
laughter)..this comes through Sinnoh Elite4 to
Professor Oak as the whole thing is secret..
another serious thing Ash,can you ever get into
trouble?"Ash(smile) : "Sinnoh Elite4 and Lance of all(all
laugh) knows full well all about it bit by bit from
the very beginning,never any worries..(all clap)..no
matter how much fooling around i've ever done or
is doing,i only do with Lance's full consent and
knowledge,just the process is mine(all laugh)..(all
smile)..so no worries,though i boss him around(all
brusts into laughter)...
Brock(smile) : "so i finish but the Doctor will haunt
Oak Labs soon"(all laugh and cheer)
Daisy&Lillie(Unison) : "personally and equally
welcomed"(all laugh and clap and all)
Gary(smile) : "hey grandpa too wants to insinuate
in(all brusts into laughter)
Professor Oak : "Hellow all!"
(all reciprocates)
Professor Oak : "well i guess someone gone
AWOL is around a Lake somewhere in a forest(all
brusts into laughter)..how things are going there
Misty?(all laughs)
Misty(blush,smile) : "Thanks Professor! and yesthings are truely AWOL(all laugh)"
Professor Oak(laugh) : "well Ash,i've just been able
to get rid of your Legend Killer(all brusts into
laughter)..he was as usual rather researching
me(all laughs).. anyway as usual you bunch is
once only,i'm only lucky to see them and there
master and now his little flower(all smile)
Ash(smile) : "yeah thanks professor and i also
have a Once Only family there as well(all
smile)..and my bunch too(all claps)..anyhow mom
as usual won't leave her father so she is there
still."
Professor Oak : "well as usual here as well, always
a great place for weekends after tedious gym
sessions(all laugh,smile) despite the Cape(all
laugh)"
Ash(smile) : "yeah,always,by the way professor
just a request as you yourself do understand
better,keep Mime away from my bunch(all brusts
into laughter)"
Professor Oak(laughes) : "absolutely so,nowonder,she's a wonder now actually to the
bunch(all brusts into laughter)..Ash,i would only
say if Oak Lab is what it is now is also because of
your bunch,and you,Once Only,so i only wish best
of luck to you and two the new captains!"
Ash(smile) : "thanks once ever,professor!"
Gary&Tracy: "Thanks Professor and your wish will
always be our command!"
Professor Oak : "thanks young ones!now the main
thing but before that another thing is that Ash,how
are the fearows(all brusts into laughter)?"
Ash(laugh) : "could only grow the half as usual(all
brusts into laughter).. what's up with Muk,any new
type immunity or adaptibility possible?"
Professor Oak(laugh) : "no,only more intellectual
(all brusts into laughter)..but that's not exactly
good for me(all brusts into laughter)...Ash,i guess
you know you also don't have to actually train
them it all about what you do yourself,they'll only
go better"
Ash(smile) : "yeah Professor, pretty much butyou'll also need to help me as usual for what is
best done for them next.. looking forward"
Professor Oak(smile) : "as usual,ever
welcome!professionally and personally!(all
laugh,smile)..well now the main thing,and that's
why i'm here,Ash your words that day and no don't
bother about that,as i hear them,just wordplay(all
smile)..i actually was searching more about your
father's diaries,a few were here with me and i just
got curious and found an amusing thing, that's
what i'll tell you just Muk embraced me in the
meantime(all laugh) and well he has freshened
me up so no trouble(all laughs)...this says well you
know just repeating...Delia would know
tomorrow..this say in excerpt, your dad and
Michael Waterflower, Misty's Dad actually were
great friends at one time(Ash and Misty looks at
each other flustered,then smiles and hugs each
other) Before Michael took up the Gym Leader's
role,but later their contact broke down due to your
father's constant travelling throughout Kanto forhis various jobs and the secrecy of the his one
time job as he worked on for 2 constant
years...but now it seems that before your dad's
final departure from () City where Michael was
doing something that day they both met suddenly
and had a good get together,but before they spoke
much about their personal life Arthur had to
leave,so though he told Michael that he was
married and all he never told anybody about his
residence cause he couldn't do that,even Delia
didn't know exactly why Arthur had to leave so
suddenly,i knew it all only,he looked upto me like
an uncle and told me everything that he actually
did and all,he always was a daredevil and his
Charmillion was as well..he did jobs for police
forces and especially against team rocket of
all..thus i came to know as a few reports about
Arthur...Michael and Arthur at one time agreed
that if they have a son and a daughter in either
side they'll get them married and make their
friendship a family relation..(all smile)...so this iswhy I was here,Ash defeated Team Rocket's boss
finally with our sweet duo(all laugh),who fooled
the whole gang completely as usually they do(all
laugh)..so Ash,Misty it also turns out that both of
you really had come here with preparation (all
laugh)..i could've said destiny but i know that word
isn't really very sweet one(all brusts into
laughter),and because of this i can now prove
rigourously as well your soulmate theory (all
laugh)..have a nice life you two,gone AWOL(all
laugh)..my best wishes!
Ash(shivering voice,smile) : "um..yeah thanks
Professor"
Misty(smile) : "thanks professor,many thanks"
.....
Daisy(smile) : "so i finally Officially tell you
Mist,that your little boyfriend Ketchum indeed
really was the only one(all laughs) and now is,
once more(all smile)"
Ash(laugh) : "well,i was a porsterboy,so now i'm
the chosenboy(all brusts into laughter)"Tracy(laugh) : "Brock,what a family and more so
what a Master,Ash Ketchum"
Brock : "perfectly uninsinuable,and more so great
in the Master's Soulmate, Misty Waterflower
Ketchum" (all clap and all)
Gary(laugh) : "well,Ash your brothers and all,turns
out a destined family as well,if plausible, what's
the next version of Crawdauntogater(all laughes
uncontrollably)"
Ash(laugh) : "i'll just want them to pokemons if
human, they'll surpass anything (all brusts into
laughter)"
Lillie(laugh) : "now all we need is the Viol flower
back,Ash can we use Charizard to fetch the little
pest?"(all laugh)
Misty(laugh) : "better preparing than fetching(all
brusts into laughter).. anyhow what have the
destined family got?"
Daisy(laugh) : "yeah now finally us of all(all
laugh)..the Master has cunningly(all laugh)
conferred all things Cerulian to only 3 of us(alllaugh)..which means..(all laugh).."
Lillie(laugh) : "you're only getting 1 Mist(all laugh),
that's all(all laugh and clap)"
Daisy(laugh) : "Cerulian of all Cities(all brusts into
laughter) will become the Master's hometown(all
clap) and thus any sludge has been cleared (all
laugh)..the City itself will receive insinuated list(all
brusts into laughter) but there's enough to
understand what they are and that'll take eternity
to finish and then another to meticulously
uninsinute(all laugh) as long as Pokemons are
concerned and all will be completely in the Gym
leader's hand to choose and do, virtually the Gym
leader is the final say anything regarding Cerulian
including the Master's grand plan of cup
competition which also will join Pewter and
Viridian and the water section is fully at the
Cerulian Gym's hand just as the rock section
which will truly be unique as Cerulian and Pewter
has a bond of totally different types,all things
regarding Rock goes to Pewter gym leader with allsay,then the Ceruliam Gym with whoever becomes
it's permanent leader will get anything she wants
in her unimaginable dreams all not specifically
mentioned but easily uninsinuable (all brusts into
laughter) as it'll be fully according to the Gym
leader whoose say,none including the Master
himself have any right legal or moral to remotely
tickle (all brusts into laughter) about it.. Virtually
the Gym Leader has become synonymous with
Gold Standard if not much higher and with her
own Hall of Fame,she has soully become(all laugh
and smile) the material equal of the Master as
well..
and this part is to be announced tomorrow noon
i'm surmising the final copy..that any kind of
unwanted feint chirping about Misty Waterflower
with regards to the Gym,Hall of Fame position,
reputation,personal life-anything in any aurhority
level if reaches the Master,he'll simply take over
the rest in his own hands with full support of
Lance,which he didn't mention but you know it..(allclap and laugh)..and that'll be done completely
legally and he'll take over all that power himself
and as his reputation goes, that's the first thing
they'll not want in their unimaginable dreams(all
brusts into laughter)...as he again mentions he
isn't a special type trainer and comparing to Misty
Waterflower,he hasn't even got his first badge of
any kind when it comes to water pokemons,but
unfortunately he has two water pokemons
himself(all brusts into laughter),who are famous
for defeating the team rocket and if anyone wants
to know more,he'll personally fix the meeting(all
laughes uncontrollably),which will we very
enjoyable (all brusts into laughter) given Cerulian's
open ocean(all Uncontrollably laughs)
it's just that,there's unimaginable power given at
the Gym Leader's hand as long as its legal,as all
legal unimaginable heavens will become a reality
in absolutely no time"(all clap and cheer)
Lillie(smile) : "this is only the gym,the master just
like his 3 friends here quote 'if the master has everknown that what means the word 'brother',he
hasn't known it rather seen it first then learnt it
later just to know how to formally describe his
relation'(all smile) and also his gratitudes for
Grandpa which quote 'all words that are there ever
in any dictionary to mention what means
'gratitude' won't be able to properly describe what
he feels for
Professor Samuel Oak so he just mentioned it for
formal description' then he briefly said how
Professor Oak like his very own grandpa has ever
done to him and his father and all and states that
'I don't want to go much further,but for me my
surname and the surname Oak makes no
difference' then he just briefly said these and
finally handed Professor Oak full authority over all
his pokemons but excluding Mime and also sadly
excluding you-chu(all brusts into laughter),as he'll
thunder-chair the whole world on the very first
notice that his little bro isn't under his full
authority(all laughes)..so Grandpa's say will befinal as to how to use the Master's pokemons for
our purposes,then finally as it happens that 3
Waterflower sisters who shares the Gym Leader's
role along with their youngst sister,for whom he
has many gratitudes cause first Cerulian was his
second badge and that too he never deserves but
was rather granted because he came could come
at a small help there as some intruders were
trying to play their games which he helped to stop
and he also holds many gratitudes and they all are
like his own big sisters as well if not more and
ultimately it happens to be that all of them has
found their soulmates from among his mentioned
brothers and vise-versa,yup that's the word(all
laughs)..then he precisely described us again with
the relationships and gave all he could and it
seems he minutely knows what Viol Flower
exactly does as well(all laughes),may be better
than she herself (all brusts into laughter)..and
accordingly his list has been made which of
course pushea us to heaven with our currentpositions and shares in gym,lab,etc,and even the
Sensational Sisters he mentioned and with
regards to our experience there and Viol being still
around,the Master has totally fooled us as to his
knowledge there as well(all brusts into
laughter),little bro,whoose knowledge is it(all
brusts into laughter)?"
Ash(laughes) : "all your managers that were ever
there and all else who knew the main things and
the Gym staffs all that are close to you and all
that, knowledge was extracted via the Dark
Types(all laughes uncontrollably), actually a
certain one Dark is alone enough for a Certain
Dark night (all brusts into laughter) if they didn't
budge(all brusts into laughter),the Pokemon was
mine,and you know i can already hear what that
certain dark pokemon in rhe night version of
forest lake is doing to our poor Azumarill(all
brusts into laughter)..she already encirculated us
thrice(all laughs) and the person was none other
than Lance's daughter (all claps and laughes)whom you know very well..(all laughes).."
Daisy(laugh) : "yeah,we know that brat(all laughes)
very well and Viol knows the best(all
laughes)..what was the carrot?"(all brusts into
laughter)
Ash(smile) : "all for her future"(all smiles and
claps)
Lillie(laugh) : "so we via Viol can hold sway over
there as well if we so wished but it's all left to our
choice and consent and there are many more for
us and for his brothers to share and so on and the
future also will get all if they came to Pokemon
world ever whatever he could he would but for
their nursery as well all things imaginable..this is
from all the gym-leader-moms and all that and
basically he has evsdropped us and his brothers
(all brusts into laughter)..and knows what we may
need may not and accordingly provided..Ash,when
did it start?"(all brusts into laughter)
Ash(smile) : "as soon as the sludge left me(all
laugh)..i just thought i'll leave Pallet so got themin, Cerulian gym would've got a list as well but if
only you here wished cause it was prepared for
excluding Misty Flower(all laughs)..and all the
powers would've been given to you but a bit
differently...after i broke into my dear flower's
room and saw her sweetly sitting on my lap(all
brusts into laughter) though she was totally
gagged and bounded by ()(all laughs) but that was
it really,my flower moves her head before my
wish,wanted to hear me before my words and so
on(all brusts into laughter),so i thought my flower
was rather enjoying it sitting like a cute little doll
there(all laughs),so i just created an extra copy of
provisions and names(all brusts into laughter)...
Daisy (laughes) : "then you fooled around with all
of us in hellfire(all brusts into laughter)..but what
about your brothers especially your cook-beau(all
brusts into laughter)..."
Ash(smile) : just the names,you remember i had
two Lackeys with me all the time till the day before
i souled my flower(all brusts into laughter).."Lillie(laugh) : "totally sinister(all brusts into
laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "straight from Elite4,Jhoto,(all brusts
into laughter)..and i had many in my alleged
farm,whom Trace was very happy to meet
today(all laughes)..how many were there Trace?"
Tracy(laugh) : "no less than 50(all brusts into
laughter).."
Ash(laughes) : "minutely picked up from around all
Elite4's barring kanto and orange(all brusts into
laughter),and tomorrow 20 more are coming (all
laughs)... they'll do as i tell them cause the threat
was that the Universal Water Queen might get
replaced by the Crawdauntly-Feraligate(all brusts
into laughter) master,and yes either of those two
always my first two(all brusts into laughter)in
extreme situations along with beloved muk,if his
type suited but even if all the 3 somehow
can't,entern the invincible tickle master,who
actually is my right hand now, that's why i can't
give him to anyone(all brusts into laughter)..hecan do things with his natural supreme powers
that he has suprassed many legends i'm sure,they
are used where my chu-bro(all laughs) can
become too protective (all brusts into
laughter)..he asks me now why are we not battling
as we're not sleeping(all brusts into laughter)...and
those two forsaken water type pests(all laugh)did
exactly that to none other than Team Socket(all
brusts into laughter) highest high(all brusts into
laughter),who opined to me personally later
that,he had Mewtwo and Arceus,but they
combined with all his other pokemons present
that would've been no match to the two gems that
has now got a exact opposite type lackey(all
brusts into laughter) and has already spoilt all that
there is to non-returnability(all brusts into
laughter) and this is night time as well(all brusts
into laughter)..and he still didn't know that i had
Ganger and Muk of all as backups(all brusts into
laughter)..i just about realized my real strength but
the antics those two utmost brats(all laughs)nonchalantly did(all brusts into laughter) that to
knowing full well they with me of all would've been
killed had they got beaten..on the face of sure
death on a ground-type surface against electric
and grass pokemons(all wonders)...they are the
only reasons there'll not be a Team Crooked 2(all
laugh)..and that's why i didn't use the brat-duo till
that day at Cerulian..and in the meantime they've
only got bratter(all laughs).. that's the thing for
me,keep them who they are,you'll see the magic if
you can follow them absolutely(all
laugh,smile,clap,cheer)...on sure death that day
against 10 absolute disadvantages that too
illegally swelles up and battle hardened with a
man who managed Metwtwo and Arceus of all if
one wasn't enough and who knew even about
everything...these two just with complete audacity
fooled around..i planned that with them but it's not
execution cause there it makes no sense,but just
who they really are and i still had Ganger and Muk
who wasn't used till the very end..you know theyare the real Pokemon Master(all claps)..all they
did was to get under their opponents nerves to
such an extent in all oppositions they were totally
baffled as neither me nor the two even tried to
attack or defend,just stood their and mentally i
was playing with them and the opposite,they just
fooled everyone around and finally the great boss
lost his greatest cool and released his eternal pet
Raven on me only to be similarly flattened by
Muk,whoose sudden presence gave my two sweet
brats to get upto the bemused high boss
personally and thwartle his plan of self
destruction,when as soon as illegal pokemons
started to flood is cause they were totally
confused as my two dears were fooling even
whoever came illegally,and as the hig boss was
totally befoold to an absolute bewilderness so he
couldn't even self destroy now my men tried to get
to him and all hell broke loose with all pokemons
only for the eventual gangerization and other
means...Ganger to fooled the lunatic pokemonswho just lost their boss to utter standstill...the
boss told me he is finally defeated cause he never
knew this was possible..and all this before Kalos
just after my break-up..3 long years...all the two
and rest of me and my people did that they but
very intuitively was to imbibe in them that there's
no point in battling and the high boss just didn't
understand how can a man standing in front of
death use these tactics and these two brats had
no control from me over them as well...i had just
let them go but i knew i could still wim intuitively
somehow cause i never found any purpose in
team rocket and my pokemons by then was
reflecting me already,these two were most
advanced in fooling around with Ganger and
Muk,but i had ganger for very few months then
and muk had some type disadvantages..so those
two,and they flattened team rocket and since that
day has become totally useless cause they'll only
ever get fully serious if i want to die with them and
against team rocket i didn't so i was saved,but thatwas then..now if i have to do that each of my 83
will become legendary themselves and this all is
barring my big-bro(all clap),he wouldn't have
fooled around that they and we would've died but
if it was a serious stuff or i have to threatened
someone to death,big bro is final say cause he
only knows from whom i'll be scared so much that
i'll want suicide,if he senses that remotely,he'll
surpass all the other 83 all by himself and isn't his
problem exactly that Trace?"
Tracy(smile) : "once only power,once only
intuition,once only applicability and skill,once only
judgement,once only self control,once only
faith,once and only Pika-bro(all claps)"
Misty(smile) : "he's telling me to threaten his bro
to battle me(all laughs),he won't battle me but he'll
get to chide his group(all laugh) for not prolonging
the match(all brusts into laughter)...yeah now i've
become his pal infact as he has understood if he
insinuated here(all laugh) his bro will be
rebuked(all laugh)..and all my sweet bro wants isto observe battles(all laugh) not get involved all
because he just wants to see if you're against
all,are you still sane to use your brain and not just
give up and go all over(all clap).. that's my
pikabro(all laughs)"
Ash(laugh) : "anyhow i just needed to share these
with all of you now that you've got control over
them, they'll obey you just like me but never try to
actually battle them cause they won't as you can
see their level all they want to know is who you are
and that's all..and at their level now they even can't
be stolen cause they'll understand their motives
and refuse to do anything spoiling all the rest to
their way,all my mates that are away
somewhere,same attitude they do the same
there..(all clap)..so Trace how were the 50?
Tracy : "personally-imbalanced(all laugh)"
Daisy(laugh) : "Mist,they called you Cerulian Water
Queen at most Kanto Water Empress,as usual
those words have been laughed off(all brusts into
laughter) to all eternal hells unimaginable andyou've become universal now that too forever
ever(all smiles and laughs,claps), provided you
can keep it,but you know soully well(all laughs)
this'll also be laughed off as mere wordplay(all
laugh and clap)"
(Ash and Misty smiles at each other and hugs
each other firmly)
Lillie : "finally Mrs Ketchum gets her Mime fully
unless she is used as a deal to adore a certain
eternal flower(all laughs)..and she can stay at
Cerulian or at Pallet,which is that she has decided-
Pallet(all claps and laughs,Ash laughs loud)..and
also hereby the Master's home comes into fully
our jurisdiction meaning Dase,me and Viol,if she
comes which is most 100% probability(all
laughs),now that finally Tracey's parents has been
cajoled here as well by the Master(all clap and
cheer) so we'll have our mother figures as well(all
clap,cheer) after the Master finally goes to
Cerulian we'll formally take over the home
department,but the most important thing is forfinally Tracy to announce"
Gary(smile) : "but just a professional intervention
(all brusts into laughter),the Master hasn't told
anyone including even his flower cause he has to
keep something with the berries (all brusts into
laughter)...
Tracy(laugh) : "just a personal intervention(all
brusts into laughter),the berries may hide some
gentle sweet fox(all brusts into laughter)..to
minutely present (all laugh) professional
observation (all brusts into laughter) in personal
matters(all brusts into laughter) of the 1st and the
2nd(all brusts into laughter) with precise
sketches(all laughes uncontrollably)..may the
balance return(all brusts into laughter)"
Misty(laugh) : "just an actual intervention(all
brusts into laughter),why is it so Trace that a few
vultures are circulating us even at deep night(all
brusts into laughter),why is it so important that a
boy can be obliviously matured?(all brusts into
laughter)Brock(laughing) : "well um..Ash was.."
Misty(laugh,frown) : "hey,hey you croocked
doctor(all brusts into laughter), don't utter my
husband's name(all brusts into laughter) and don't
go out of Viridian(all brusts into laughter)..my
husband isn't it,my husband?(all brusts into
laughter)..why does it seem that people are so
infatuated with my husband suddenly(all brusts
into laughter)?... Gyarados,i give you my word,if
these guy tries to enter Cerulian Gym(all brusts
into laughter),at midnight with his Onix(all laughes
uncontrollably),then you'll never see me again"(all
brusts into laughter)
Gary(laugh) : "right,professing personally (all
brusts into laughter),but keeping in mind of
professional matters(all laughs),in an intuitively
balanced manner (all brusts into laughter),that the
Master has already faced a brat named Hi-Ho(all
wonder including Misty,who huggs Ash,Ash smiles
at Misty and hugs her),when he was challenged
privately after his Elite4 victory in Kanto,when heillegally went on Charizard,racing to Kalos in A,that
is highest level record time(all laughs),where as
upto only C level from basic H is allowed for any
hall of fame masters unless professional or he is
a gym leader,so master has personally broken the
current professional world record(all laughes),he
went to the famous library of (),to formally
understand the soulmate theory,there some ()
sludge who was a dreaded villian alleged to have a
Hi-Ho privately challenged him and the master
accepted cause he was too sure only flying types
are no good(all laugh)..try telling that to Charizard
Ash(all brusts into laughter),so he used Muk of
all(all brusts into laughter) to an intensional type
disadvantage against a Hi-Ho of all legends cause
he believed in quote 'ah just a half-grown illegally
f.. up f.. fearow'(all brusts into laughter) and our
sweet hugging muk of all brats(all laughs) went
there and told the Hi-Ho in the Master's language
'are you sane bro?(all brusts into laughter)you
don't even know how to behave with humans'(allbrusts into laughter),and then just went onto hug
the Master to death (all brusts into laughter)..the
legends villian master was defeated exactly
there(all brusts into laughter),cause though he
knew well that the master would fool around,he
never expected a self deatructive move like this(all
laughs),so he instantly said 'i give up'(all brusts
into laughter),which made the legend sober(all
brusts into laughter) as he was poisoned and all
that,the legend in Master's interpretation tries to
comeback as ' you coward,you get tamed by
human,all swear words' to which our Muk sweetly
says 'whoose your beau'(all brusts into laughter)
which made the legend to go overdrive and
prepare to charge with absolute insanity,when
muk absolutely in the precise right time sweetly
countered 'what if i'm?'(all brusts into
laughter)...this makes the legend to simply give up
and stay flustered,which bought the time(all
brusts into laughter) for muk to state 'can't all fight
like beaus do?'(all brusts into laughter)..this sendsthe legend to such heaven that he hugs-it-out(all
brusts into laughter)...and the Villian to say he
would'nt ever even recall the name Pokemon(all
brusts into laughter),what to speak of anything
else (all laughs)...so our muk beats a Hi-OH with
unsoulmate theory (all laughes
uncontrollably)..but the Master politely states that
had it been none other than his sidelick manger(all
brusts into laughter),the legend would've also
been supplimented with the art of beau-tickling
(all uncontrollably laughs)..which would've made
the legend the least mortal(all brusts into
laughter) and his villian master curse his birthday
(all brusts into laughter)..from which the Master
granted them pardon(all brusts into
laughter)..thus the master has indeed laughed off
a legend as well,which is a secret from Kalos
Elite4 reached Grandpa just before we strated the
call..Grandpa would've been for some moments
connected with us but this statement so
entertainingly made by Percy,the head there thathe actually said i'm going to research the night out
thoroughly that how can a gentleman-brat like
muk pull that off(all brusts into laughter),which
the brat himself agreed to only if he could
personally hug each sophisticated instruments
professionally(all brusts into laughter)..make it
cunning Trace(all laughes uncontrollably)"
Tracy(solemn) : "Finally a day after tomorrow the
Master will tell the world that why he was so
interested in Cerulian City Gym(all laughs),
Officially and why he is so concerned about the
name Misty Waterflower (all laugh)..um..(all
laugh)
Ash(laugh) : "all 1000 feets in 100 times (all brusts
into laughter)
Tracy(laughes) : "so the Master will declare finally
from AWOL via Lance(all laugh and clap) that it is
someone who'll get absolutely all equal share of
his powers and all reachs and this makes that
someone to virtually do whatever she wants to
regarding water pokemon world and if it's her wishthe master will gleefully make sure that she
doesn't have any problems, including opening
once evet bug Gym(all laughes uncontrollably),so
the Master hereby has virtually all his powers and
all to himself (all laughes) as Misty Waterflower
and finally hereby declares as if the world still
hasn't understood(all brusts into laughter) in 15
years(all brusts into laughter) that the Pokemon
Master Hall of Fame with the Special Distinction
of Being the absolute top head on all affairs
regarding Pokemon Training,yup they've done it
themselves as Lance made sure of his and his
Daughter (all brusts into laughter),by the way his
brothers are also in top notch places now and
their soulmates too have the shares and all that
and he also made sure that the Cerulian Gym's
Leader is repayed by all means as she was being
humiliated there despite being in hall of fame and
the authorities must get it very clearly that this
gym and the leader is very important to the
Master(all brusts into laughter) virtually makingMisty Universal Water Empress once ever in Hall
of Fame with all distinctions as the Master says
he's not a specialist in any types but has had to
his biggest misfortune two water pokemons(all
laughes uncontrollably) who are infinite
encyclopedias themselves(all brusts into
laughter),so he knows full well given the right
environment the Universal Water Empress would
as usual make the name meaningless(all
clap)..and if Misty or any of you want to revive the
show there are things there as well and all
that..the 50 sweet gentlemen and women must've
died now(all brusts into laughter)and they had 20
backups(qll brusts into laughter)..so Master has
as he totally fooled around the with the Pokemon
world just like they themselves and now has
distributed all that he has given us some powers
regarding if he's not present what to do and all and
there's other people as well accordingly but every
single of this and all if anyone has any right in the
Master's absence temporary or permanent over allthat the Master has throughout said and all else
virtually it means if Master's body isn't available to
the world, it's just replaced by his here he finally
decides to unearth the flower(all brusts into
laughter),to be wife with whom he has already got
engaged privately (all brusts into laughter),through
all hells(all brusts into laughter)..so the master
legally told the soulmate theory to give all euqual
shares including all of his pokemons including Mr
Mime and finally his beloved big-bro(all clap) to
his would be wife which,the official ceremony will
take place in Cerulian City Gym(all brusts into
laughter) and yes on the central battleground (all
brusts into laughter) and then another long list of
invitations and all specialities and all that only
from Master's side and all rest the decoration etc
and all are left over to his wife..so basically the
master says just recognize me and my wife as
one and the same and get the hell out of here(all
brusts into laughter)..so,hereby with all his and her
titles and details given finally,Ash Ketchum marries Misty Waterflower..(all clap
and cheer and all)...
finally to us it's said in footnote,(all laughs),the
Vultures has been finally put to rest for this life(all
brusts into laughter) but if plausible,they'd better
remember any trial to disturb Ash Ketchum and
Misty Waterflower will fetch them same
results,thus finally Ash Ketchum uninsinutes his
longing for his Beau(all brusts into laughter),his
soulmate eternal,Misty Waterflower and marries
her just to make Official the inevitability in all
plausible eternity in similar circumstances (all
clap and cheer)...
.....(an hour later)...
(Ash and Misty hugging each other firmly,looking
at each other and smiling)
Ash : "just a ceremony to announce"

Misty(smile) : "lets get over with the formalities?"
Ash(smile) : "sweety,soul it to absolute
sweetest,just gave up too early"
Misty(smile) : "but.."
Ash(smile) : "excitement or .."
Misty(smile) : "lets battle,eternal lunacy"
Ash(smile) : "that's my sweet Misty Flower,lets
battle,this same position,same posture,

Misty(laugh) : "why break the mood sweety?"
Ash(laugh) : "need our brats at absolute lunatic
attention(both brusts into laughter), including big-
chu(both laughs)
(after settling everything,10 minutes later,Ash and
Misty same position,but just about could continue
eye contact)
Ash&Misty(Unison,smile) : "lets battle absolute
lunacy perfectly shared"
(they continue to be in that position being
absolutely still for half an hour then Misty just fallsagainst Ash out of total exhaustion,15 minutes
later)
Ash(solemn,hugging Misty) : "need to strengthen
and recover well in Pinkenberry Mist, that's exactly
why i persisted with 2 weeks,i'll manage all the
things you tell me to,you should take complete
rest at home...i'm so unhappy to see my sweet
flower in such weak condition...this is so amusing
but my sweety got totally exhausted so soon that
too because my dear went with all mental
strength...and before that just got too
emotional,we'll come here all we want Mist,but in
good times ok,sweety? don't rush, your health
won't allow for much of normalcy what to talk of
soul?..please..
Misty(resting on Ash,exhausted,mild voice) : "um..
it's just you Ash,i just..just don't want to leave your
side at all.."
Ash(smile, tendering Misty's head) : "i won't take
any risks Mist..but you must get healthy,7 months
with those,just too much,if something pains mestill is the agony i saw in my little sweety after the
7th...my sweety has been a gym leader and
performer,so much vitality always since the very
first,but that day,i knew i'll pressure you Mist but
after 6th i was pretty concerned just the
contents,and the 7th was horrible...you should
take complete rest.."
Misty(smile) : "i'm already having enough
sweety,but(laugh)..how did you(laugh).."
Ash(laugh) : "no i freaked you out i guess(both
brusts into laughter)...you were a cute little doll at
15 and ok i wanted to smack your head then(both
brusts into laughter),but after 3 months couldn't
think without you,since then i just know my Misty
flower soully(both giggle at each other).."
Misty(laugh) : "before that i was totally
confused,but(laugh)..as soon as that
happened,after i calmed down a bit i was scared
to death(both laughes)...no Ash,that was really
enough,unless you were connected by souls,you
could never do that..you never looked at me in anyother way than your soulmate..."
Ash(firmly hugging Misty) : "i just wish i could
fondle my sweet Misty flower a bit more(Misty
giggles)...we were together for 5 years day and
night,i don't miss those days cause(laugh)..
Misty(laugh) : "all those journeys are vulture
business now(both brusts into laughter)"
Ash(laugh) : "yeah,I guess,but i'll tender my flower
all i want now(both smile)..privately alone in
seclusion(both brusts into laughter)...

was heaven.."
Ash(laugh) : "um..was?"(both laughes
uncontrollably)
Misty(laugh) : "is being"(both brusts into laughter)

one thing Mist,are you all right?...
Misty(smile) : "honey,i'm absolutely fine,a bit of
troubles here and there,only cure in my moon(both
sleep).Ash(smile) : "you know Mist,i just recalled what i
thought after your 7th,i just thought that,just leave
it,i'll just abduct you and runway anywhere and
fondle my soul all i want(Misty giggles),and now i
know what i should've done they day my sweety
had to part after jhoto,same just get the damn
bike,destroy it again,and abduct my flower Plain
and Simple(both laugh)...Mist,can i abduct
you,please,please,you are so soully sweet sweet?"
(both laugh)
Misty(smile) : "all ways,sweety"

do it in public,but now i know, just do it after
ceremony (both brusts into laughter)"
Misty(smile,almost whisper) : "um..Ash..just..."
Ash(laugh) : "if less Cerulianized(both laugh),notmore than 5(both smiles at each other)

moment forget the vehicle,at the highest mental
level like gratitude,longing etc,forget the
vehicle,and you'll be so drunk,no need for anything
else.

smiles at each other and hugs each other)(few moments later)
